The neckline of this pattern is around 1350.260010, which was the closing price on 04/01/2024. Today's price closing below this neckline indicates a bearish reversal and suggests a downward trend.

    <td>CCZ</td>
    <td>Neutral</td>
    <td>Based on the provided data, there are no clear buy or sell signals from the technical indicators we are considering.

Price action over the past two years has been relatively sideways, with a range of approximately $5 between the high and low. There are no key reversals, double tops, double bottoms, head and shoulders, or inverse head and shoulders visible in the data.

Support and resistance levels are also not clearly defined, as the stock price has been bouncing between $56 and $59 for an extended period of time.

Volume has been relatively low and inconsistent, making it difficult to use as a reliable indicator.

Therefore, based on this analysis, I would recommend a neutral stance on this stock.</td>

<td>COST</td>
<td>Sell</td>
<td>The stock has formed a double top pattern at 717.130005 and 710.809998, with a neckline at 705.690002. The price has broken below the neckline, indicating a bearish reversal. Additionally, volume has been decreasing as the price approached the double top, which is a bearish sign. The next level of support is at 697.270020, which was the low of the second top. A break below this level would confirm the double top and could lead to further downside.

Additionally, the volume on April 4, 2024, was higher than the previous day, which could indicate increased selling pressure. There is also a potential double top pattern that has formed with the highs on April 11, 2022, and April 2, 2024, with a neckline around 122.

<tr>
    <td>ORCL</td>
    <td>Neutral</td>
    <td>Based on the provided data, there are no clear buy or sell signals from the technical indicators we are considering.

Price action over the past two years shows a general upward trend, but there have been some recent declines. There is a support level around 124.00, which was tested on 2024-04-04, and held. This could indicate a potential buying opportunity if the price dips below this level again. However, without further confirmation from other indicators, it is difficult to make a definitive recommendation.

There are no clear head and shoulders, inverse head and shoulders, double tops, double bottoms, or key reversals present in the data. Volume has been relatively stable, with no significant spikes or drops that might indicate increased buying or selling pressure.

Therefore, based on the available data and technical indicators, our recommendation is to remain neutral at this time.</td>

However, today's price action shows a bearish reversal with the stock closing near the low of the day. There is also a possibility of a double top pattern forming with the recent high at 196.300003 and the current price being lower than that level.
