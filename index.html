1. Channels:
We are currently in a descending channel, with the price finding resistance at the upper trendline and support at the lower trendline. Based on the most recent candle, we are near the bottom of the channel.
2. Triangles:
There is no clear triangle pattern forming at the moment.
3. Support and Resistance:
We are currently near a strong resistance level at the upper trendline of the descending channel. A break above this level could indicate a potential reversal in trend. The next potential move would be a test of the previous high around 150.
4. Head and Shoulders:
There is no clear head and shoulders pattern forming at the moment.
5. Inverse Head and Shoulders:
There is a potential inverse head and shoulders pattern forming, with the left shoulder and head already formed. We are currently in the process of forming the right shoulder. A break above the neckline around 145 could indicate a potential reversal in trend and a move towards the target of 165.
6. Key Reversals:
There is a potential key reversal pattern with the most recent candle. The long wick on the top of the candle indicates that there was significant selling pressure at higher prices, while the close near the low of the candle indicates that buyers were able to regain control by the end of the week. This could indicate a potential change in sentiment and a move lower.
7. Double Bottom:
There is no clear double bottom pattern forming at the moment.
8. Double Top:
There is no clear double top pattern forming at the moment.
9. Adam and Eve Double Top:

10. Adam and Eve Double Bottom:
There is no clear Adam and Eve double bottom pattern forming at the moment.

Based on my analysis, I believe that we are currently in a descending channel and are near the bottom of the channel.

Additionally, there is a potential key reversal pattern with the most recent candle, which could indicate a potential change in sentiment and a move lower.
