The stock closed below the neckline on 2024-04-09, confirming the bearish signal. Additionally, volume has been increasing on down days, which is a bearish sign. Therefore, I recommend selling this stock.</td>

<td>Based on the provided data, there are no clear buy or sell signals from the technical indicators we are using (price action, support and resistance, head and shoulders, inverse head and shoulder, key reversals, double bottom, double top, Adam and Eve double top, Adam and Eve double bottom, and volume). The stock price has been in a relatively narrow range for the past few days, and there are no clear patterns or significant volume spikes that would suggest a strong trend. Therefore, a neutral stance is recommended.</td>

  <td>ADBE</td>
  <td>Buy</td>
  <td>The stock price has been in an uptrend, with higher highs and higher lows. On 09/04/2024, the price closed near the high of the day, indicating strong buying pressure. Additionally, the price broke above a key resistance level at 490, which could signal the start of a new uptrend. The volume on the breakout day was also higher than average, which adds credence to the breakout. Therefore, a buy verdict is recommended.</td>

  <td>AMD</td>
  <td>Sell</td>
  <td>The stock has formed a double top pattern at 171.600006, which is a bearish signal. Additionally, volume has been decreasing as the price reached the peak, which is another bearish signal. The support level is around 169.0, so a good sell target would be around this level.</td>

<td>The stock price has been in an uptrend since 2022-04-14, with several key reversals and higher highs and higher lows. The stock also formed an inverse head and shoulders pattern between 2022-04-14 and 2024-04-05, indicating a potential trend reversal to the upside. The stock broke above the neckline of the inverse head and shoulders pattern on 2024-04-05, adding further confirmation to the bullish outlook. Additionally, volume has been increasing on the rallies, which is a bullish sign. Therefore, I recommend a "buy" on this stock.</td>

    <td>Buy</td>
    <td>Based on the price data provided, the stock has been in an uptrend, with higher highs and higher lows. There is a key reversal on 2024-04-09, where the stock made a new high but closed near the low of the day, indicating selling pressure. However, the volume on this day was lower than the previous day, which suggests that the selling pressure may not be strong enough to reverse the uptrend. Additionally, the stock has found support at around 980, which is a previous resistance level, indicating a potential support and resistance flip. Therefore, I would recommend a 'buy' verdict with an expectation that the stock may continue its uptrend.</td>

<td>Neutral</td>
<td>The stock price has been in a general downtrend since April 11, 2022, with a few minor rallies. There have been several key reversals, double tops, and a head and shoulders pattern, all of which suggest a bearish outlook. However, the stock has found support around the 66-67 range, which has held for the past few days. The volume has been decreasing, indicating a lack of strong conviction from buyers or sellers. Therefore, it may be best to adopt a neutral stance until a clearer trend emerges.</td>

Additionally, there are no visible support or resistance levels, head and shoulders, key reversals, double bottoms, double tops, Adam and Eve double tops, Adam and Eve double bottoms, or volume increases that would typically indicate a strong buy or sell signal.

 <td>COST</td>
 <td>Buy</td>
 <td>Based on the price data provided, the stock has been in an uptrend since 2022-04-11, with several key reversals and higher highs and higher lows. There are no clear head and shoulders or double top/bottom patterns that would suggest a reversal. The volume has been decreasing slightly as the price has risen, but this is not necessarily a bearish sign. Overall, the trend is still bullish and I would recommend a 'buy' verdict. Additionally, the most recent close price at 718.59 is above the previous resistance level of 716.14 (on 2024-04-08) and also above the previous high of 716.89 (on 2024-04-05) which is a bullish sign.</td>

  <td>The stock has been in an uptrend since April 14, 2022, with several bullish patterns identified. These include a key reversal on April 13, 2022, where the stock made a lower low but closed higher than the previous day's close. Additionally, there is a potential inverse head and shoulders pattern forming, with the "head" at $189.162903 on April 14, 2022, and the "shoulders" at $194.555862 on April 12, 2022, and $195.464676 on April 13, 2022. The "neckline" of this potential pattern is at $195.720001. If the stock breaks above this level with strong volume, it could be a bullish signal. Currently, the stock is trading above its 50-day moving average, which is a positive sign. Therefore, a buy verdict is recommended.</td>

Additionally, the stock has broken above the neckline resistance of 50.00 with a strong bullish candle on 09/04/2024, confirming the reversal. Therefore, the verdict is to buy with a target price of 52.50 (calculated by adding the distance between the double bottom and the neckline to the breakout point) and a stop loss at 48.25 (just below the neckline).</td>

The stock price closed below the neckline of the double top pattern on 04/09/2024, confirming the bearish signal. However, the volume on 04/09/2024 was lower than the previous days, which could indicate a lack of conviction in the bearish move.

    <td>Based on the provided data, there are no clear buy or sell signals from the technical indicators we are considering.

Price action over the past two years has been relatively range-bound, with the stock trading between $59 and $65 per share. There have been no significant breaks above resistance or below support levels during this time.

There are no double tops or double bottoms in the data. Similarly, there are no Adam and Eve double tops or double bottoms.

Volume has been relatively stable over the past few months, with no significant spikes or drops that would suggest increased buying or selling pressure.

Price action over the past two years has been generally trending upwards, with some fluctuations. However, there are no clear key reversals, double tops or bottoms, or head and shoulders patterns that would suggest a significant change in trend.

In terms of support and resistance, the price has found support around the 48-50 range and has encountered resistance around the 58 range. However, without further data or context, it is difficult to determine the significance of these levels.
