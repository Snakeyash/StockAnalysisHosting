This candle pattern is characterized by a long lower wick and a small body near the high of the candle. The long lower wick indicates that there was significant selling pressure during the period, but the bulls managed to push the price back up, resulting in a close near the high.<br /><br />**Price Action:**<br /><br />The open price of the candle is lower than the close price, which is a bullish sign. Additionally, the high of the candle is significantly higher than the open price, indicating strong buying pressure.<br /><br />**Relative Strength Index (RSI):**<br /><br />The RSI for the last closing candle is 70.54, which is above the overbought threshold of 70.<br /><br />**Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD):**<br /><br />The MACD indicator is bullish, with the MACD line crossing above the signal line.<br /><br />**Conclusion:**<br /><br />Based on the provided technical analysis, the last closing candle is a bullish candle, with a long lower wick and a small body near the high. The open price is lower than the close price, and the high is significantly higher than the open price. The RSI is above the overbought threshold, but the MACD indicator is bullish. Overall, the technical analysis suggests that the stock is in a bullish trend, but investors should be aware of the potential for a short-term correction due to the overbought RSI. It's important to note that technical analysis is not a guarantee of future performance, and investors should always do their own research and consider their own risk tolerance before making investment decisions.</td></tr><tr class='child-table AAPL'><td colspan='4'><table><thead><tr class='child-table-parent AAPL'><th>Daily Market Close</th><th>Daily Prediction</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr class='daily-child-data'><td>2024-06-28</td><td>bullish</td><tr class='daily-child-data'><td colspan='2'>**Stock Market Analysis Report**----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br /><br />**Last Closing Candle:** 2024-06-28<br /><br />**Open:** $215.77 (0.00000427246094)<br /><br />**High:** $216.07 (0.00000732421875)<br /><br />**Low:** $210.30 (0.0000030517578)<br /><br />**Close:** $210.62 (-$4.15)<br /><br />The last closing candle's price action reveals a bearish trend, as the closing price was lower than the opening price by $5.15. This significant price difference indicates a strong bearish sentiment in the market.<br /><br />**Volume:** 82,475,600<br /><br />The volume for the last closing candle was 82,475,600, which is higher than the previous candle's volume of 69,518,590. This increased volume suggests a higher level of market participation and interest during this time frame.<br /><br />**Technical Indicators:**<br /><br />**50-day Simple Moving Average (SMA):** 189.8298 (0.0000046875)<br /><br />**200-day Simple Moving Average (SMA):** 183.2167 (0.0000021057128)<br /><br />The 50-day SMA is currently above the 200-day SMA, which is generally considered a bullish signal. However, the last closing candle's close price is below both the 50-day and 200-day SMAs, which could be interpreted as a bearish sign.<br /><br />**Relative Strength Index (RSI):** 30.51<br /><br />The RSI for the last closing candle is 30.51, which is in the neutral to oversold region (below 30). This could indicate that the stock might be oversold and could potentially rebound.<br /><br />**Conclusion:**<br /><br />The last closing candle's bearish trend, significant price difference, and increased volume suggest a strong bearish sentiment in the market.

This candle has a small lower body with a long upper wick, indicating that the price tried to rise but was unable to sustain the gains and eventually closed near the opening price.<br /><br />**Technical Indicators:**<br /><br />- **Relative Strength Index (RSI):** The RSI for this candle is 4.8129, which is quite low, suggesting that the stock may be oversold.<br />- **Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD):** The MACD is still positive, indicating that the overall trend is still bullish.<br /><br />**Candle Analysis:** Despite the bearish nature of the last candle, it may not be the best time to be bearish just yet. It would be advisable to wait for further confirmation of a trend reversal, such as a break below the 50-day moving average or a lower close on higher volume. For now, it might be best to maintain a neutral stance or consider smaller, conservative positions.<br /><br />**Opening Prices of Previous Candles:**<br /><br />| **Date** | **Opening Price** |<br />| --- | --- |<br />| 2024-06-19 | 201.59504556412116 |<br />| 2024-06-18 | 191.29915478559235 |<br />| 2024-06-17 | 186.0175994873047 |<br />| 2024-06-16 | 191.29915478559235 |<br />| 2024-06-15 | 182.32260417300725 |<br />| 2024-06-14 | 182.80254997253417 |<br />| 2024-06-13 | 191.29915478559235 |<br />| 2024-06-12 | 201.59504556412116 |<br />| 2024-06-11 | 209.67999267578125 |<br />| 2024-06-10 | 213.92999267578125 |<br /><br />**Highs and Lows of Previous Candles:**<br /><br />| **Date** | **Highest Price** | **Lowest Price** |<br />| --- | --- | --- |<br />| 2024-06-20 | 214.24000549316406 | 208.85000610351562 |<br />| 2024-06-19 | 201.59504556412116 | 201.59504556412116 |<br />| 2024-06-18 | 191.29915478559235 | 186.0175994873047 |<br />| 2024-06-17 | 191.29915478559235 | 182.80254997253417 |<br />| 2024-06-16 | 191.29915478559235 | 182.32260417300725 |<br />| 2024-06-15 | 191.29915478559235 | 182.32260417300725 |<br />| 2024-06-14 | 191.29915478559235 | 182.80254997253417 |<br />| 2024-06-13 | 191.29915478559235 | 190.53339947570801 |<br />| 2024-06-12 | 209.67999267578125 | 208.85000610351562 |<br />| 2024-06-11 | 209.67999267578125 | 209.67999267578125 |<br />| 2024-06-10 | 213.92999267578125 | 213.92999267578125 |</td></tr><tr class='daily-child-data'><td>2024-06-18</td><td>bearish</td><tr class='daily-child-data'><td colspan='2'>**Technical Analysis Report**______________________________________________<br /><br />**Last Closing Candle Data:** ______________________________________________<br /><br />| **Property**          | **Value**                                                        |<br />|-----------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------|<br />| Date                | 2024-06-18                                                       |<br />| Open                | 217.58999633789062                                               |<br />| High                | 218.6300048828125                                               |<br />| Low                 | 213.0                                                           |<br />| Close               | 214.2899932861328                                               |<br />| Adj Close            | 214.2899932861328                                               |<br />| Volume              | 79854200                                                        |<br /><br />**Technical Indicators:** ______________________________________________<br /><br />| **Indicator**          | **Value**                                                        |<br />|-----------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------|<br />| Close vs Open         | The close is lower than the open                                |<br />| SMA_50                | 182.88219940185547                                               |<br />| SMA_200              | 183.7856002807617                                               |<br />| EMA_50               | Above the closing price                                          |<br />| EMA_200              | Above the closing price                                          |<br />| RSI_14               | 42.47584320330585                                               |<br />| MACD_12_26_12        | -2.508117405570175                                              |<br />| MACDh_12_26_12      | Below the MACD line                                             |<br />| BB_20_2.0            | Close is near the lower Bollinger Band                           |<br />| STOCHk_14_3_3        | 80.76041239474082                                              |<br />| ATRr_14              | 3.420113598222926                                               |<br /><br />**Observations:** ________________________________________________________<br /><br />* The close is lower than the open, indicating a bearish signal.<br />* The close is below both the 50-day SMA and 200-day SMA, which are bearish signals.<br />* The EMA_50 and EMA_200 are above the closing price, which is a bearish signal.<br />* The RSI_14 is in neutral territory and doesn't provide a clear signal.<br />* The MACD is negative and the signal line is below the MACD line, which is a bearish signal.<br />* The close is near the lower Bollinger Band, which is a bearish signal.<br />* The Stochastic Oscillator is in overbought territory, suggesting a potential downward correction.<br />* The Average True Range indicates high volatility.<br /><br />Based on the technical analysis of the last closing candle, a bearish outlook is suggested.

The high price of the day was 1041.7099609375, and the low price was 1024.6400146484375. The closing price falling between the high and low prices suggests that the market experienced some fluctuation but ultimately closed near the day's middle.<br /><br />The stock's 50-day simple moving average (SMA) is 951.6978015136718, and the 200-day SMA is 771.4184723632472. Since the closing price is above both the short- and long-term moving averages, it indicates an upward trend in the stock's performance.<br /><br />The stock's 14-day relative strength index (RSI) is 58.67644176667002, which is close to the neutral zone (50). This value suggests that the stock is not overbought or oversold at the moment.<br /><br />The moving average convergence divergence (MACD) indicators are as follows: the MACD line is 14.127970360360678, the signal line is -4.710451558695752, and the histogram is 18.83842191905643. The positive MACD line indicates a bullish trend, but the histogram's narrowing gap suggests that the bullish momentum may be slowing down.<br /><br />The Bollinger Bands, with a 20-day lookback period and a 2.0 standard deviation, show the following values: the upper band (BBU) is 1014.8570207304872, the middle band (BBM) is 968.0830454049361, and the lower band (BBL) is 921.309070079385. The closing price is near the middle band, which indicates that the stock is trading within the expected range.<br /><br />The stock's 14-day stochastic K%D line is 0.6773497621800763, which is above the 0.5 level, indicating that the stock is in the upper part of its recent price range.<br /><br />The average true range (ATR) for 14 days is 28.582979411259945, which measures market volatility. The current ATR value suggests that the stock has been experiencing moderate volatility.<br /><br />Based on the last closing candle's qualities and relevant technical details, the stock market is showing mixed signals. While the closing price is above both short- and long-term moving averages, the narrowing gap in the MACD histogram and the stock's position in the Bollinger Bands suggest a potential slowdown in the bullish trend. However, the stock's stochastic K%D line being above the 0.5 level and the positive MACD line still indicate a bullish outlook.<br /><br />Therefore, it may be prudent to adopt a neutral stance, carefully monitoring the stock's performance and waiting for clearer trends to emerge before making a decision to be bullish or bearish.</td></tr><tr class='daily-child-data'><td>2024-06-26</td><td>bullish</td><tr class='daily-child-data'><td colspan='2'>**Stock Market Report**-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br /><br />**Trading Day:** 2024-06-26<br /><br />**Closing Price:** 1016.5999755859375<br /><br />**Opening Price:** 1014.0<br /><br />**50-day Simple Moving Average (SMA):** 925.5808020019531<br /><br />**200-day Simple Moving Average (SMA):** 769.1920247266263<br /><br />**50-day SMA > 200-day SMA:** Yes<br /><br />**Closing Price > 50-day and 200-day SMAs:** Yes<br /><br />**Relative Strength Index (RSI):** 55.36392784803285<br /><br />**RSI Range:** Neutral (above 30 and below 70)<br /><br />**Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) Histogram:** 19.694867657001108<br /><br />**MACD Signal Line > MACD Histogram:** Yes<br /><br />**Bollinger Bands:**<br /><br />* Closing Price near Upper Band<br />* Price within Bollinger Bands<br /><br />**Average True Range (ATR):** 28.582979411259945<br />-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br /><br />The closing price on 2024-06-26 was higher than the opening price, indicating a bullish sentiment for the day.

However, the last closing price is below both SMAs, which could be a bearish signal.<br /><br />**Relative Strength Index (RSI):**<br /><br />The RSI for the last closing price was 60.470378889917036, which is above the 50 threshold, suggesting that the stock is not overbought. However, the RSI has been decreasing, indicating weakening momentum.<br /><br />**Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD):**<br /><br />The MACD lines were above zero, but the signal line had crossed below the MACD line, which is a bearish signal.<br /><br />**Bollinger Bands:**<br /><br />The last closing price was near the lower Bollinger Band, indicating that the stock is oversold. However, this could also be a bearish signal if the price continues to fall and breaks through the lower band.<br /><br />**Conclusion:**<br /><br />Based on the analysis, the last closing candle does not indicate a good time to be bullish, as the price has closed lower than the open and is below both SMAs. However, the RSI and Bollinger Bands suggest that the stock may be oversold, which could present a buying opportunity for traders who believe the price will rebound. Overall, a neutral to slightly bearish stance is recommended.</td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr><tr class='parent-row buy inconclusive_daily' id='AZN'><td>AZN</td><td>AstraZeneca PLC American Depositary Shares</td><td>2024-06-28</td><td>bullish</td></tr><tr class='explanation-table AZN'><td colspan='4'>**Weekly Stock Market Analysis**<br /><br />**Date:** 2024-06-24<br /><br />**Stock Closing Price:** 79.25<br /><br />**Previous Week's Closing Price:** 75.83999633789062<br /><br />**Price Trend:** The stock closed higher than the previous week's close, indicating a bullish trend.<br /><br />**Opening Price:** 79.5<br /><br />**High for the Week:** 79.87000274658203<br /><br />**Low for the Week:** 77.83000183105469<br /><br />**50-day Moving Average (SMA_50):** 68.88939949035644<br /><br />**200-day Moving Average (SMA_200):** 56.19760069097348<br /><br />**Moving Average Trend:** Both moving averages are trending upwards, indicating a bullish trend.<br /><br />**50-day Moving Average (SMA_50) vs 200-day Moving Average (SMA_200):** The stock's 50-day moving average is above its 200-day moving average, which is a bullish signal.<br /><br />**Relative Strength Index (RSI_14):** 3.0081605883423<br /><br />**RSI Status:** The stock's RSI is in neutral territory.<br /><br />**Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD_12_26_12):** Positive<br /><br />**MACD Histogram (MACDh_12_26_12):** Positive<br /><br />**Bollinger Bands (BB_20_2.0):** The stock's price is near the upper band, indicating that the stock is overbought.<br /><br />**Price Action:** Based on the last closing candle and the relevant technical details, the stock appears to be in a bullish trend.

Investors may want to wait for further price action before making a decision.</td></tr><tr class='child-table COST'><td colspan='4'><table><thead><tr class='child-table-parent COST'><th>Daily Market Close</th><th>Daily Prediction</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr class='daily-child-data'><td>2024-06-28</td><td>bearish</td><tr class='daily-child-data'><td colspan='2'>**Stock Market Analysis Report**______________________________________________<br /><br />**Date:** 2024-06-28<br /><br />**Last Closing Price:** 849.989990234375<br /><br />**Open Price:** 851.25<br /><br />**High:** 857.239990234375<br /><br />**Low:** 846.8099975585938<br /><br />**Volume:** 2131400<br /><br />**Moving Averages:**<br /><br />* 50-day SMA: 796.7538024902344<br />* 200-day SMA: 686.7053518676757<br />* 50-day EMA: 812.4884968101208<br />* 200-day EMA: 842.3505084048769<br /><br />**Technical Indicators:**<br /><br />* RSI (14): 12.07525256481314 (Oversold)<br />* MACD (12, 26, 9): 4.29148683398847, 51.49574152692591, -12.07525256481314<br />* Bollinger Bands (20): BBU: 858.330009765625, BBM: 849.3099975585938, BBB: 840.2899780273438, BBP: 0.510706310116238<br />* Stochastic Oscillator (14, 3): 19.622522741250503, 15.6469131806831, 3.9756095605674027<br />* ATR (14): 12.07525256481314<br /><br />**Observations:**<br /><br />The last closing candle for the 90-day price data from the daily chart on 2024-06-28 shows a decrease in price from the previous day's close.

Analysis**<br /><br />The last closing candle on 2024-06-26 has a bullish bias, with a higher close compared to the open and a higher high compared to the previous day. The stock has been trading above its 50-day and 200-day moving averages, indicating a positive trend. The RSI value of 59.72 suggests that the stock is not overbought, leaving room for further upside potential.<br /><br />However, the MACD histogram has been decreasing, indicating a potential bearish divergence. The STOCHastic oscillator is also showing a bearish crossover, which could suggest a short-term pullback.<br /><br />In summary, while the overall trend remains bullish, investors should be aware of potential short-term weakness. A pullback to the support level around the 50-day moving average could provide a buying opportunity for those looking to enter or add to their positions. However, stops should be set to limit potential losses if the stock breaks below this support level.</td></tr><tr class='daily-child-data'><td>2024-06-25</td><td>bullish</td><tr class='daily-child-data'><td colspan='2'>**Stock Market Report**______________________________________________<br /><br />**Trading Day:** 2024-06-25<br /><br />**Closing Price:** 855.510009765625<br /><br />**Analysis:**<br /><br />The closing price on 2024-06-25 is higher than the previous day's close, indicating a potential bullish sentiment.

This is determined by the fact that the closing price (47.290000915527344) is higher than the opening price (47.06999969482422). This indicates that the buying pressure was stronger than the selling pressure during this period.<br /><br />Additional technical details about the last closing candle include:<br /><br />* The **body** of the candle is relatively large, indicating strong buying pressure.<br />* The close is near the **high** of the candle, which is another bullish sign.<br />* The **upper wick** is relatively small, suggesting that the bulls maintained control throughout the period.<br />* The **lower wick** is also small, indicating that there was little to no bearish activity during this period.<br /><br />**Market Trend**<br /><br />Based on the analysis of the last closing candle, the market trend is currently **bullish**. This suggests that it might be a good time to consider adopting a bullish stance, such as buying the stock or investing in a bullish financial instrument.

Investors should exercise caution and consider additional technical and fundamental analysis before making investment decisions.</td></tr><tr class='daily-child-data'><td>2024-06-18</td><td>neutral</td><tr class='daily-child-data'><td colspan='2'>**Stock Market Analysis Report**______________________________________________<br /><br />**Date:** 2024-06-18<br /><br />**Closing Price:** 153.3300018310547<br /><br />The stock closed at a price of **153.33** on 2024-06-18, which is **0.22** lower than the opening price of **153.55**.

This is a slightly lower close than the previous week's close of 109.88999938964844, indicating a potential downward trend. However, the closing price is still above the 50-day simple moving average (SMA) of 101.54923998624638 and the 200-day SMA of 96.9816275888688, which could be interpreted as a bullish sign.<br /><br />**Technical Indicators**<br /><br />The RSI for the last closing price is 5.97252656, which is well below the oversold threshold of 30, indicating that the stock is not oversold. The MACD histogram is negative at -3.099067, suggesting a bearish trend. However, the MACD lines are still above the signal line, which could be interpreted as a bullish sign.<br /><br />The Bollinger bands show that the last closing price is near the lower band, indicating that the stock is currently trading near the lower end of its recent range. The stochastic oscillator is at 7.22133092, which is below the oversold threshold of 20, indicating that the stock is oversold.<br /><br />**Conclusion**<br /><br />The last closing candle suggests a mixed picture, with some bullish and bearish signals. The stock is trading near the lower end of its recent range, but it is still above key moving averages. The RSI and stochastic oscillator suggest that the stock is oversold, while the MACD histogram suggests a bearish trend. Therefore, it may be wise to adopt a neutral stance and closely monitor the stock's performance in the coming weeks.</td></tr><tr class='child-table FMX'><td colspan='4'><table><thead><tr class='child-table-parent FMX'><th>Daily Market Close</th><th>Daily Prediction</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr class='daily-child-data'><td>2024-06-28</td><td>bearish</td><tr class='daily-child-data'><td colspan='2'>**Stock Market Analysis Report**________________________________________<br /><br />**Date:** 2024-06-28<br /><br />**Closing Price:** 107.6500015258789<br /><br />**Candle Type:** Bullish<br /><br />**Opening Price:** 106.08<br /><br />**High:** 107.83<br /><br />**Low:** 106.08<br /><br />**Volume:** 542,100<br /><br />**Technical Indicators:**<br /><br />1. **Moving Averages:**<br />   * 50-day SMA: 110.04839904785158<br />   * 200-day SMA: 119.51654987335205<br />   * The 50-day SMA is below the 200-day SMA, indicating a potential downtrend.<br />   * The last closing candle is still above the 50-day SMA.<br /><br />2. **Relative Strength Index (RSI):** 50.10602172963771<br /><br />3. **Moving Average Convergence/Divergence (MACD):** The MACD line is below the signal line, indicating a bearish signal.<br /><br />4. **Bollinger Bands:** The stock is trading near the lower Bollinger Band, suggesting that it might be oversold.<br /><br />5. **Average True Range (ATR):** 2.80999174493465<br /><br />**Market Conditions:**<br /><br />Based on the analysis of the last closing candle and its technical details, the stock market is currently in a downtrend, as indicated by the 50-day SMA being below the 200-day SMA.

The price range for this candle was relatively narrow, with a high-low range of **4.34 points** and an open-close range of **1.60 points**. This suggests that market sentiment was not particularly strong during this period.<br /><br />The stock's **closing price** of **443.1400146484375** was above both the **50-day simple moving average (SMA)** of 437.2089990234375 and the **200-day SMA** of 403.42811698621216.

This indicates that the stock was neither overbought nor oversold.<br /><br />The **Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD)** lines were below the signal line, indicating a bearish signal.

However, the stock's closing price was above both the 50-day and 200-day SMAs and near the lower Bollinger Band, which could indicate a buying opportunity.<br /><br />Investors should consider these factors and conduct further research before making investment decisions.</td></tr><tr class='daily-child-data'><td>2024-06-21</td><td>bullish</td><tr class='daily-child-data'><td colspan='2'>**Technical Analysis Report**__________________________________________<br /><br />**Price Data for Last Closing Candle (2024-06-21):**<br /><br />| **Metric**          | **Value**                       |<br />|---------------------|--------------------------------|<br />| Open                | 443.3999938964844               |<br />| High                | 443.9800109863281               |<br />| Low                 | 440.0                           |<br />| Close               | 442.75                          |<br />| Volume              | 3,866,863                       |<br /><br />**Technical Indicators:**<br /><br />* Relative Strength Index (RSI): 53.41<br />* Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD): Positive but flat<br /><br />**Observations:**<br /><br />The last closing candle exhibits a slightly bearish trend as the closing price is lower than the opening price.

Nonetheless, the overall trend remains bullish.</td></tr><tr class='daily-child-data'><td>2024-06-24</td><td>bullish</td><tr class='daily-child-data'><td colspan='2'>**Stock Market Report**------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br /><br />**Trading Day:** 2024-06-24<br /><br />**Closing Price:** 890.1099853515625<br /><br />**Technical Analysis:**<br /><br />* **50-day SMA:** 730.900400390625<br />* **200-day SMA:** 600.9011999511719<br />* **50-day EMA:** 788.6300059542092<br />* **200-day EMA:** 602.717762403815<br />* **RSI:** 59.75300806014152<br />* **MACD:**<br />  * **MACD Line:** 11.270915483267686<br />  * **Signal Line:** 15.033132998432366<br />* **Bollinger Bands:**<br />  * **Last Closing Price:** Within Upper Band<br />  * **Bandwidth:** 20.24177716859855<br />* **Stochastic Oscillator:**<br />  * **%K Line:** 65.25460020877911<br />  * **%D Line:** 18.09642994026467<br /><br />**Observations:**<br /><br />* The closing price is above both the 50-day SMA and 200-day SMA, indicating an uptrend.<br />* The EMAs also suggest an uptrend.<br />* The RSI is close to the neutral threshold of 50.<br />* The MACD indicators are positive, suggesting a bullish signal.<br />* The last closing price is within the upper Bollinger Band, indicating that the price is relatively high compared to the recent past.<br />* The SO is in the middle of its range, indicating a neutral signal.<br /><br />**Conclusion:**<br /><br />Based on the technical analysis of the last closing candle, the stock market is showing signs of an uptrend.

However, investors should also consider other factors, such as the company's fundamentals and market conditions, before making a decision.</td></tr><tr class='daily-child-data'><td>2024-06-26</td><td>neutral</td><tr class='daily-child-data'><td colspan='2'>**Stock Market Analysis Report**______________________________________________<br /><br />**Date:** 2024-06-26<br /><br />**Closing Price:** **\*\*\*\*257.8299865722656\*\*\*\***<br /><br />The stock closed at a price of 257.8299865722656, which is slightly lower than the opening price of 258.1700134277344, indicating a **\*\*\*slight decrease in price during the day\*\*\***.<br /><br />**High Price:** **\*\*\*258.67999267578125\*\*\***<br /><br />The high price of the day was 258.67999267578125.<br /><br />**Low Price:** **\*\*\*254.67999267578125\*\*\***<br /><br />The low price was 254.67999267578125.<br /><br />**Volume:** **\*\*\*2,552,372\*\*\***<br /><br />The stock's volume for the day was 2,552,372, which is **\*\*\*relatively low compared to some of the previous days in the dataset\*\*\** and could indicate decreased interest or lower trading activity in the stock.<br /><br />**50-day SMA:** **\*\*\*290.43059814453125\*\*\***<br /><br />The stock's 50-day simple moving average (SMA) is 290.43059814453125.<br /><br />**200-day SMA:** **\*\*\*283.27189880371094\*\*\***<br /><br />The stock's 200-day SMA is 283.27189880371094.<br /><br />**RSI:** **\*\*\*42.257706797251515\*\*\***<br /><br />The stock's relative strength index (RSI) for the past 14 periods is 42.257706797251515, which is in **\*\*\*neutral territory\*\*\** (RSI values above 70 indicate that a stock may be overbought, while values below 30 suggest that a stock may be oversold).<br /><br />**MACD:**<br /><br />The stock's moving average convergence divergence (MACD) histogram is negative, indicating that the **\*\*\*short-term trend is downward\*\*\**; however, the MACD lines are close together, suggesting that the downtrend may be **\*\*\*weakening\*\*\** (the MACD lines represent the difference between the 12-day and 26-day exponential moving averages, and the histogram shows the difference between the two signals).<br /><br />**Conclusion:**<br /><br />The last closing candle does not provide a clear indication of whether to be bullish or bearish on the stock. The slightly lower closing price and low volume could suggest decreased interest in the stock, but the long-term moving averages and neutral RSI suggest that the stock may be undervalued.

A value of 50 suggests that the stock is neither overbought nor oversold.<br /><br />**Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD):**<br /><br />The MACD for the last closing candle was close to neutral territory, with the MACD line (12-day exponential moving average - 26-day exponential moving average) at -0.005 and the signal line (9-day exponential moving average of MACD) at 0.006. The MACD line crossing above the signal line would indicate a bullish signal, while a cross below would indicate a bearish signal. At the current values, the MACD is not providing a clear signal.<br /><br />**Conclusion:**<br /><br />The last closing candle is a bullish candle, but the RSI and MACD are close to neutral territory. This suggests that the stock may be in a consolidation phase and that it may be a good time to be cautiously optimistic about the stock. However, it is important to wait for further confirmation before making any investment decisions.</td></tr><tr class='daily-child-data'><td>2024-06-18</td><td>bearish</td><tr class='daily-child-data'><td colspan='2'>**Stock Market Analysis Report**______________________________________________<br /><br />**Market Data:** __________________________________________________________<br /><br />* Date: 2024-06-18<br />* Open Price: **253.9499969482422**<br />* High: **254.35000610351562**<br />* Low: **249.35000610351562**<br />* Close: **250.7899932861328**<br /><br />**Technical Indicators:** ________________________________________________<br /><br />**Relative Strength Index (RSI):**<br />* Value: **40.05**<br />* Interpretation: Neutral (Nor overbought nor oversold)<br /><br />**Exponential Moving Averages (EMA):**<br />* 12-day EMA: **253.5154113769531**<br />* 26-day EMA: **253.25476370248396**<br />* Close is below both EMAs: Bearish signal<br /><br />**Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD):**<br />* MACD line: **-2.741097933513288**<br />* Signal line: **-1.4136573402663106**<br />* MACD lines are negative: Bearish trend<br /><br />**Bollinger Bands:**<br />* Close is near the lower band: Bearish signal<br /><br />**Average True Range (ATR):**<br />* Value: **22.324221977378937**<br />* Interpretation: High volatility<br /><br />**Conclusion:** ___________________________________________________________<br /><br />Based on the last closing candle and the technical indicators, the stock appears to be in a bearish trend.

The RSI is in the neutral zone, but the high volatility indicated by the ATR may suggest increased market uncertainty.

The open price for the last candle is 131.27000427246094, the high is 134.6300048828125, and the low is 120.87000274658203.<br /><br />The stock has been on a downward trend for the past few weeks, with the last candle being no exception. However, the stock has shown some resilience, as it has not fallen below the 120 mark despite the downward pressure.<br /><br />The stock's 50-day simple moving average (SMA) is 116.00479904174804, and the 200-day SMA is 99.61082957292159. The stock is currently trading above both of these moving averages, which is a bullish sign. However, the stock's relative strength index (RSI) is 3.2076278137025156, which is well below the oversold threshold of 30, indicating that the stock may be oversold.<br /><br />The stock's moving average convergence divergence (MACD) is also bearish, with the MACD line crossing below the signal line. This is a bearish signal, indicating that the stock may continue to fall in the near term.<br /><br />In conclusion, the last closing candle suggests that the stock may be oversold and due for a rebound. However, the stock's downward trend and bearish MACD signal suggest that caution is warranted. Investors may want to wait for a confirmation of a trend reversal before initiating a long position. Overall, the stock's technical indicators suggest a neutral to slightly bearish outlook.</td></tr><tr class='child-table MRK'><td colspan='4'><table><thead><tr class='child-table-parent MRK'><th>Daily Market Close</th><th>Daily Prediction</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr class='daily-child-data'><td>2024-06-28</td><td>bearish</td><tr class='daily-child-data'><td colspan='2'>**Stock Market Analysis Report**______________________________________________<br /><br />**Date:** 2024-06-28<br /><br />**Last Closing Price:** 123.80000305175781<br /><br />**Previous Closing Price:** 129.51169097469528<br /><br />**Price Change:** -5.711687949254677<br /><br />**Volume:** 59,034,830<br /><br />**Relative Strength Index (RSI):** 2.958551592959804<br /><br />**Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD):**<br /><br />* **MACD Line:** -6.821181114291542<br />* **Signal Line:** 2.8799998857934273<br /><br />**Trend:**<br /><br />The last closing candle (2024-06-28) has a lower close price than the previous day (2024-06-27), indicating a potential downward trend.

However, the stock was overbought, as indicated by the RSI, MACD, and stochastic oscillator.<br /><br />Therefore, while the bullish sentiment is strong, it may be a good time to be cautiously optimistic and consider taking profits if you are long on the stock.</td></tr><tr class='daily-child-data'><td>2024-06-20</td><td>bullish</td><tr class='daily-child-data'><td colspan='2'>**2024-06-20 Stock Market Report**--------------------------------------------------<br /><br />**Last Closing Candle Characteristics:**<br /><br />- Open: 190.49000549316406<br />- High: 193.44000244140625<br />- Low: 190.2100067138672<br />- Close: 191.47000122070312<br /><br />**Technical Indicators:**<br /><br />- **Simple Moving Averages (SMA):**<br />  - SMA50: 187.38280090332032<br />  - SMA200: 151.08140007019043<br />- **Exponential Moving Averages (EMA):**<br />  - EMA50: 188.38280090332032<br />  - EMA200: 152.80300018310547<br />- **Relative Strength Index (RSI):** RSI14: 59.026227029211108<br />- **Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD):**<br />  - MACD_12_26_12: 0.400790942058985<br />  - MACDh_12_26_12: 0.9842135176042346<br />  - MACDs_12_26_12: -4.200790942058985<br />- **Bollinger Bands (BB):** Close price near upper BB<br />- **Stochastic Oscillator (SO):**<br />  - STOCHk_14_3_3: 85.05385003063583<br />  - STOCHd_14_3_3: 98.01472936295899<br /><br />**Observations:**<br /><br />The last closing candle represents a bullish engulfing pattern, which suggests a potential trend reversal or a strong bullish sentiment.

Therefore, a cautiously optimistic and neutral to slightly bullish stance is recommended for the short term.</td></tr><tr class='daily-child-data'><td>2024-06-20</td><td>bearish</td><tr class='daily-child-data'><td colspan='2'>**Technical Analysis Report**______________________________________________<br /><br />**Date:** 2024-06-20<br /><br />**Price Data:**<br /><br />| **Metric**          | **Value**                          |<br />|---------------------|------------------------------------|<br />| Open                | 560.8499755859375                   |<br />| High                | 560.8499755859375                   |<br />| Low                 | 551.7100219726562                   |<br />| Close               | 557.2100219726562                   |<br />| SMA_50             | 563.1561999511719                   |<br />| SMA_200            | 524.3602006530762                   |<br />| EMA_50             | 563.5939648680958                   |<br />| EMA_200            | 535.5909755520044                   |<br />| RSI_14             | 56.74366527615005                   |<br />| MACD_12_26_12     | -2.4157096320405866                |<br />| MACDh_12_26_12    | 9.149234780595846                   |<br />| MACDs_12_26_12    | -6.733525148555259                  |<br />| BBL_20_2.0        | 559.8153737346043                   |<br />| BBM_20_2.0        | 580.2919669725705                   |<br />| BBU_20_2.0        | 600.7685602105367                   |<br />| BBB_20_2.0        | 7.0573416153920645                  |<br />| BBP_20_2.0        | 0.56832337416632                    |<br />| STOCHk_14_3_3     | 560.7348863121649                   |<br />| STOCHd_14_3_3     | 579.6508270283823                   |<br />| ATRr_14            | 37.30524228418998                   |<br /><br />**Observations:**<br /><br />The following technical details are based on the provided price data for the last closing candle on 2024-06-20:<br /><br />1. The last closing price is 557.2100219726562, which is lower than the previous day's close.<br />2. The candle is a bearish candle (close < open) with a small real body and a long lower wick, indicating selling pressure but also some buying support near the low.<br />3. The 50-day SMA (Simple Moving Average) is above both the 200-day SMA and the last closing price, which is a bearish signal.<br />4. The RSI (Relative Strength Index) is at 56.74, which is close to the neutral line (50), but slightly favors the bears.<br />5. The MACD (Moving Average Convergence Divergence) is negative (-2.4157), indicating a bearish trend.<br />6. The Bollinger Bands show that the last closing price is near the lower band, suggesting that the price is oversold in the short term.<br />7. The Stochastic Oscillator is also indicating oversold conditions, with the %K line (560.7348) below the %D line (579.6508).<br /><br />These observations suggest a bearish outlook for the stock market based on the technical analysis of the last closing candle. However, the oversold conditions may lead to a short-term bounce. It is essential to consider other factors and indicators for a comprehensive analysis.</td></tr><tr class='daily-child-data'><td>2024-06-18</td><td>bearish</td><tr class='daily-child-data'><td colspan='2'>**Analysis Report**------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br /><br />**Last Closing Candle**<br />---------------------<br /><br />The last closing candle in the provided 90 days of price data is for the trading day of **2024-06-18**.

The 50-day EMA is also below the closing price, indicating potential bearish momentum. However, the RSI is at 48.44, which is close to the neutral zone (50), and the MACD histogram is slightly above the signal line, indicating a weak bullish signal.<br /><br />The Stochastic Oscillator is in the oversold region, suggesting that a potential rebound might occur. However, the ATR indicates high volatility in the recent past.<br /><br />In conclusion, the last closing candle does not provide a clear indication of a strong bullish or bearish trend. Investors should remain cautious and consider the overall market conditions and other factors before making investment decisions. A neutral to slightly bearish stance might be appropriate, considering the 50-day and 200-day SMAs and EMAs. However, the oversold Stochastic Oscillator and weak bullish MACD signal warrant monitoring for potential bullish opportunities.</td></tr><tr class='daily-child-data'><td>2024-06-26</td><td>neutral</td><tr class='daily-child-data'><td colspan='2'>**Stock Market Analysis Report**______________________________________________<br /><br />**Date:** 2024-06-26<br /><br />**Open:** 484.5<br /><br />**High:** 487.44<br /><br />**Low:** 481.5<br /><br />**Close:** 484.04<br /><br />**Analysis:**<br /><br />The closing price of the stock on the given date exhibited a bullish trend, as the closing price was higher than the opening price.

This indicates a lack of substantial buying or selling pressure.<br /><br />The 14-day Relative Strength Index (RSI) was recorded at 49.6, which is close to the neutral zone of 50.
