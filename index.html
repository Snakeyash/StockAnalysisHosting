4. Head and Shoulders:

There is no clear head and shoulders pattern forming at the moment.

5. Inverse Head and Shoulders:

There is a potential inverse head and shoulders pattern forming, with the left shoulder formed at the $147.91 level. The head is currently forming and the right shoulder is yet to form.

Based on my analysis, I would recommend keeping an eye on the potential inverse head and shoulders pattern.

Re-checking my analysis based on the price data provided, I confirm that my analysis is correct. Therefore, my final answer is complete.



In summary, we are currently in a descending channel and near a support level. There is a potential inverse head and shoulders pattern forming, which could indicate a bullish reversal if the right shoulder forms and the neckline is broken.

2. Triangles - There is no clear triangle pattern forming at the moment.

3. Support and resistance - We are currently near a support level, with the previous resistance level at around 448.00. The next potential move could be a breakthrough of this support level, which could lead to further downward movement.

4. Head and shoulders - There is no clear head and shoulders pattern forming at the moment.

5. Inverse head and shoulders - There is no clear inverse head and shoulders pattern forming at the moment.

6. Key reversals - There is no clear key reversal pattern at the moment, but the recent price action suggests a potential change in sentiment, with the price failing to break through the previous resistance level.

7. Double bottom - There is no clear double bottom pattern at the moment.

9. Adam and Eve double top - There is no clear Adam and Eve double top pattern at the moment.

10. Adam and Eve double bottom - There is no clear Adam and Eve double bottom pattern at the moment.



Based on my analysis, I would recommend being cautious and monitoring the price action closely.

However, it's important to note that these patterns are not guaranteed and can change quickly based on new price data.



I would recommend re-evaluating the price data regularly and adjusting your strategy as needed. Additionally, it's important to consider other factors that could impact the stock's price, such as market conditions, news events, and company fundamentals.</td></tr>

4. Head and shoulders - There is no clear head and shoulders pattern forming at the moment.

5. Inverse head and shoulder - There is a potential inverse head and shoulder pattern forming, with the left shoulder near $49 and the head near $50. If the right shoulder forms around the current price level, it could signal a bullish reversal.

6. Key reversals - There is a potential key reversal pattern in the most recent candle, with a higher high and a lower low than the previous candle. This could indicate a potential change in sentiment.

7. Double bottom - There is no clear double bottom pattern forming at the moment.
