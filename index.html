<td>AAPL</td>
<td>Neutral</td>
<td>The price action over the past two years has been relatively sideways, with no clear trend. There have been some signs of support around 160 and resistance around 175, but these have not been consistently tested. There are no clear head and shoulders, inverse head and shoulders, key reversals, double bottoms, or double tops present in the data. Volume has been relatively low and stable, with no significant spikes or drops. Therefore, based on this analysis, I would recommend a neutral position.</td>

  <td>ABBV</td>
  <td>Sell</td>
  <td>The stock has formed a double top pattern at the end of the provided data, with the two peaks at 181.029999 and 171.970001, and a lower trough in between. This pattern suggests a bearish reversal and a potential downward trend. Additionally, the volume has been decreasing as the price approached the second peak, which is another bearish signal. Therefore, a sell recommendation is advised.</td>

  <td>ACN</td>
  <td>Neutral</td>
  <td>Based on the provided data, there are no clear buy or sell signals from the technical indicators we are using (price action, support and resistance, head and shoulders, inverse head and shoulder, key reversals, double bottom, double top, Adam and Eve double top, Adam and Eve double bottom, and volume). The stock price has been in a relatively narrow range for the past few days, and there is no clear trend or reversal pattern. Additionally, there is no significant increase or decrease in volume that would suggest a change in market sentiment. Therefore, our analysis is neutral at this time.</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>ADBE</td>
<td>Neutral</td>
<td>The stock price has been in an overall uptrend since 2022-04-11, but there are some potential bearish signals. On 2024-04-04, there was a key reversal day with a higher open and lower close, which could indicate a potential trend change. Additionally, the stock formed a double top pattern on 2024-04-02 and 2024-04-03, which is typically a bearish signal. However, volume has been decreasing during this time period, which could indicate a lack of conviction among sellers. Therefore, a neutral stance is recommended until further price action confirms a clear trend.</td>

<tr>
    <td>AMD</td>
    <td>Sell</td>
    <td>The stock has formed a double top pattern at $180.10 and $171.66, with a neckline at $169.89. The recent break below the neckline indicates a bearish reversal, suggesting a 'sell' position.</td>
</tr>

<tr>
    <td>AMZN</td>
    <td>Buy</td>
    <td>The stock price has been in an uptrend since 2022-04-14, with a series of higher highs and higher lows. There was a key reversal on 2024-04-04, where the stock made a lower low but closed higher, indicating buying pressure. The stock also broke above a resistance level around 180 on 2024-04-04, which could provide further upside potential. Additionally, the volume has been increasing on up days, which is a bullish sign. Therefore, I recommend a "buy" verdict.</td>
</tr>

<tr>
    <td>ASML</td>
    <td>Buy</td>
    <td>The stock has been in an uptrend since 2022-04-11, with higher highs and higher lows. There was a key reversal on 2024-04-04, where the stock made a lower low but closed higher, indicating a potential trend change or consolidation. However, the stock quickly resumed its uptrend and made a new high on 2024-04-08. The volume has been increasing on the up days, which is a bullish sign. There is no clear resistance level above the current price, so the path of least resistance is up. Therefore, I recommend a "buy" verdict.</td>
</tr>

<tr>
  <td>AVGO</td>
  <td>Buy</td>
  <td>The stock price has been in an uptrend, with higher highs and higher lows. Although the price dropped slightly in the last few days, it found support around 1330 levels, which was a resistance level in the past. This is a bullish sign, as it shows that buyers are willing to buy at higher prices. Additionally, the volume on the recent drop was lower than the volume on the preceding rally, which is another bullish sign. Therefore, I recommend a "buy" verdict.</td>
</tr>


<tr>
  <td>AZN</td>
  <td>Neutral</td>
  <td>The stock price has been in a general downtrend since April 11, 2022, with a few minor rallies. There are no clear bullish patterns such as a double bottom or inverse head and shoulders. However, there is also no clear bearish pattern such as a head and shoulders or double top. Volume has not been particularly high on any of the days, indicating that there hasn't been any strong buying or selling pressure. Therefore, based on the price data and indicators provided, the recommendation is to remain neutral.</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>BAC</td>
<td>Neutral</td>
<td>The stock price has been in a relatively narrow range between 37 and 39 for the past two years, with no clear trend or significant breakouts. There have been some key reversals and potential double tops and bottoms, but the volume has not been particularly high during these events. Additionally, there do not appear to be any clear support or resistance levels that would indicate a strong buying or selling opportunity. Therefore, a neutral stance is recommended until there is a clearer signal or trend in the price action.</td>

    <td>CCZ</td>
    <td>Neutral</td>
    <td>Based on the provided historical price data from 2022-04-11 to 2024-04-08, there are no clear patterns or significant indicators for this stock. The price has remained constant around 59.000000 from 2022-04-11 to 2022-04-18 and around 55.700001 from 2024-04-02 to 2024-04-08. There are no key reversals, double tops, double bottoms, head and shoulders, or inverse head and shoulders visible. Additionally, the volume is zero for most of the days, which is unusual and not helpful in making an informed decision.</td>
</tr>

<tr>
  <td>COST</td>
  <td>Neutral</td>
  <td>The price has been in an uptrend since April 11, 2022, with several higher highs and higher lows. However, the price has been consolidating in a range for the past few days, with support around 705-710 and resistance around 715-720. There are no clear bearish or bullish patterns such as head and shoulders, double tops/bottoms, or key reversals. Volume has been decreasing during this consolidation period, which could indicate a lack of conviction from buyers or sellers. Therefore, a neutral stance is recommended until a clearer trend emerges.</td>
</tr>

<tr>
  <td>CRM</td>
  <td>Buy</td>
  <td>Based on the price data provided, we can identify a potential inverse head and shoulders pattern, which is typically a bullish signal. The "head" of the pattern occurred on 2022-04-14 with a low of 189.162903, and was preceded by a higher left shoulder and followed by a higher right shoulder. The "neckline" of the pattern can be drawn at around 196, and the stock price broke above this level on 2024-04-05, indicating a potential buy signal. Additionally, volume increased on the breakout day, which is another bullish signal. Therefore, based on this analysis, the verdict is to buy.</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>CSCO</td>
<td>Neutral</td>
<td>The price data from 2022-04-11 to 2024-04-08 shows no clear patterns or indicators that would suggest a 'buy' or 'sell' verdict. There are no significant key reversals, double bottoms, double tops, or head and shoulders patterns present in the data. Additionally, while there is some volatility in the price action, there is no clear trend or support/resistance level that would suggest a strong directional move. Therefore, a 'neutral' verdict is appropriate.</td>
</tr>

<tr>
  <td>CVX</td>
  <td>Neutral</td>
  <td>The price action over the past two years has been relatively range-bound, with no clear trend. There have been some signs of a potential inverse head and shoulders pattern, but it has not yet confirmed. The volume has not shown any significant increase or decrease during this period. Therefore, a neutral stance is recommended until there are more clear signals.</td>
</tr>

<tr>
  <td>DIS</td>
  <td>Sell</td>
  <td>Based on the price data provided, the stock has been in a downtrend since April 13, 2022, with lower highs and lower lows. There are also signs of a double top pattern, which is a bearish reversal pattern, formed by the highs on April 12, 2022, and April 3, 2024. The volume has also increased on the recent decline, which could indicate selling pressure. Therefore, I would recommend a sell verdict.</td>
</tr>

<tr>
  <td>FMX</td>
  <td>Neutral</td>
  <td>Based on the provided data, there are no clear buy or sell signals from the technical indicators we are considering. There is no head and shoulders, inverse head and shoulder, double bottom, double top, Adam and Eve double top, or Adam and Eve double bottom patterns present. The price has been in a relatively narrow range with no clear support or resistance levels. The volume has not shown any significant increase or decrease. Therefore, our analysis is neutral at this point.</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>GOOGL</td>
<td>Buy</td>
<td>Based on the price data provided, we can identify a key reversal pattern on 04/04/2024, where the stock closed significantly higher than its open price, indicating a potential trend reversal. Additionally, the stock has been trading above its 50-day moving average since then, which is a bullish signal. The stock also formed a double bottom pattern in late March and early April, which is also a bullish signal. Therefore, I would recommend a "buy" verdict for this stock.</td>
</tr>

<tr>
  <td>HD</td>
  <td>Neutral</td>
  <td>The price has been in an uptrend since April 11, 2022, with several higher highs and higher lows. However, the price formed a double top pattern on April 3 and 4, 2024, which is a bearish signal. The price also broke below the neckline support of the double top pattern on April 5, 2024, which further strengthens the bearish signal. However, the price recovered and closed above the neckline support on April 8, 2024, which is a bullish signal. Therefore, it is better to remain neutral until a clearer trend emerges.</td>

  <td>JNJ</td>
  <td>Neutral</td>
  <td>Based on the provided data, there are no clear buy or sell signals from the technical indicators we are considering (price action, support and resistance, head and shoulders, inverse head and shoulder, key reversals, double bottom, double top, Adam and Eve double top, Adam and Eve double bottom, and volume). The stock price has been in a general downtrend since April 2022, but there are no clear patterns or reversals in the recent data. Additionally, volume has not been particularly high on any of the days, which suggests that there has not been significant buying or selling pressure.

<td>META</td>
<td>Buy</td>
<td>The stock price has been in an uptrend since 2022, with several bullish patterns identified. These include a head and shoulders pattern in 2023, which resulted in a breakout above the neckline and a new high. Additionally, there is evidence of key reversals and increasing volume on up days, which further supports a buy verdict. The stock also formed an Adam and Eve double bottom pattern in 2024, which is a bullish reversal pattern. The stock has since broken above the resistance level of the double bottom pattern, providing further confirmation of the uptrend.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
  <td>MRK</td>
  <td>Sell</td>
  <td>The stock price has been in a downtrend since 04/14/2022, with a series of lower highs and lower lows. On 04/08/2024, the price formed a key reversal day by making a new low at 126.559998 and closing above the previous day's high of 127.639999, indicating a potential trend change. However, the volume on this day was lower than the previous day, which is not a strong confirmation of a trend reversal. Additionally, the price has not yet reached a clear level of support, which increases the risk of further downside. Therefore, it is recommended to sell this stock.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
    <td>MSFT</td>
    <td>Buy</td>
    <td>The stock price has been in an uptrend since 2022-04-13, with a series of higher highs and higher lows. There was a key reversal on 2024-04-04, where the stock made a lower low but closed higher, indicating buying pressure. The stock also broke above a resistance level around 420, which had previously been a double top. The volume has been decreasing as the price has risen, which is a bullish sign. However, the volume spiked on the most recent day, which could be a warning sign of a potential reversal. Overall, the trend is bullish and the stock appears to be in a strong uptrend, so a buy verdict is recommended.</td>

    <td>NFLX</td>
    <td>Buy</td>
    <td>The stock price has been in an uptrend since April 11, 2022, with several instances of key reversals and higher highs and higher lows. The stock formed a double bottom pattern on April 14, 2022, and April 18, 2022, which is a bullish pattern. The stock also formed an inverse head and shoulders pattern from April 12, 2022, to April 18, 2022, which is also a bullish pattern. The stock broke above the neckline of the inverse head and shoulders pattern on April 23, 2022, which is a buy signal. The stock has also been showing higher volume on up days, which is a bullish sign. The stock has support at the 50-day moving average, which is currently at $580. Therefore, I recommend buying the stock.</td>

  <td>NVDA</td>
  <td>Buy</td>
  <td>The stock has been in an uptrend, with higher highs and higher lows. Although the price dropped slightly in the last few days, it found support around 870, which was a resistance level in the past. This is a bullish sign, as it shows that the stock is able to hold above this level. Additionally, the volume on the most recent drop was lower than the preceding days, which could indicate that the selling pressure is decreasing. Therefore, I would recommend a "buy" verdict.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
    <td>NVO</td>
    <td>Neutral</td>
    <td>The stock price has been in an overall uptrend since 2022-04-11, with several support levels along the way. However, the most recent price action shows a potential double top pattern, with the highs on 2024-04-03 and 2024-04-08, and a lower high on 2024-04-05. This pattern is not yet confirmed, as we would need to see a break below the neckline around 125.05. Additionally, volume has been decreasing during this time period, which is not typically bullish. However, there is also no clear resistance level above the current price, so there is no strong bearish case at the moment. Therefore, a neutral stance is advised until further price action confirms a trend reversal or continuation.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
    <td>ORCL</td>
    <td>Neutral</td>
    <td>Based on the provided data, there are no clear buy or sell signals from the technical indicators we are considering.

Price action over the past two years shows a general upward trend, with the stock price increasing from around $80 to $125. However, there are no recent key reversals, double tops, double bottoms, or head and shoulders patterns that would suggest an immediate trend change.

Support and resistance levels are also not clearly defined in the recent data. While the price has dipped below $124 in the past few days, it has not stayed there long enough to establish a strong support level. Similarly, there is no clear resistance level above the current price.

Volume has been relatively consistent, without any spikes that would suggest unusual buying or selling activity.

Therefore, based on these indicators, we would recommend a neutral position for this stock at the current time.</td>

The volume has been decreasing as the price has been increasing, which is a bullish sign.

These include a key reversal on April 11, 2022, where the stock closed higher after a period of decline, and a double bottom pattern on April 12-14, 20224, where the stock found support at around 167 and bounced back. More recently, the stock has formed an inverse head and shoulders pattern from April 18, 2023, to April 8, 2024, indicating a potential trend reversal to the upside. The stock broke above the neckline of the pattern on April 5, 2024, and has since continued its upward momentum. Additionally, volume has been increasing during the recent uptrend, which is a bullish sign. Therefore, based on these technical indicators, I would recommend a "buy" verdict for this stock.</td>

<td>The stock has been in a downtrend since 2022, with a series of lower highs and lower lows.

Additionally, the stock has formed a double top pattern, with the two peaks at 342.079987 and 177.190002, and both peaks have similar volume. The confirmation of the double top pattern would be a break below the neckline, which is around 165. This, along with the overall downtrend, suggests a sell position.</td>
