There is no evidence of key reversals, double bottoms, double tops, head and shoulders, or inverse head and shoulders patterns. Price action has been relatively sideways, with support and resistance around 170 and 178 respectively, but without a clear trend. Volume has not been exceptionally high or low. Therefore, a neutral stance is advised.</td>

    <td>ABBV</td>
    <td>Buy</td>
    <td>Based on the price data provided, a key reversal pattern was identified on 2024-04-02. The stock opened at 179.389999, hit a low of 178.509995, but then reversed and closed near the high of the day at 180.690002. This is a bullish sign and suggests that the stock may continue to rise. Additionally, the stock has been in an uptrend since April 2022, with higher highs and higher lows, indicating strong buying pressure. The volume on 2024-04-02 was also higher than the previous day, which confirms the strength of the reversal. Therefore, a "buy" verdict is recommended for this stock.</td>

    <td>Neutral</td>

The price has been in a relatively narrow range for the past few months, with no clear trend or significant breaks of support or resistance levels. Additionally, there are no clear head and shoulders, inverse head and shoulders, double tops, double bottoms, or key reversals present in the data. Volume has also been relatively stable and does not provide any clear indication of a trend change. Therefore, our analysis is neutral at this time.</td>

    <td>ADBE</td>
    <td>Neutral</td>
    <td>The price has been in a general uptrend since April 2022, but there are no clear bullish patterns such as a double bottom or key reversals in the recent data. There is also no clear resistance level to indicate a sell opportunity. Therefore, a neutral position is recommended until there are more clear signals.</td>

    <td>AMD</td>
    <td>Sell</td>
    <td>The price has been in a downtrend since April 4, 2022, with a series of lower highs and lower lows. On April 1, 2024, there was a key reversal day with a higher high followed by a lower close, which is a bearish sign. Additionally, the volume has been decreasing as the price declined, which is often a sign of weakness. There is also a potential inverse head and shoulders pattern that has formed, but the right shoulder is still in the process of being formed. Given the overall downtrend and the bearish signals, I would recommend selling.</td>

There is no head and shoulders, inverse head and shoulder, key reversals, double bottom, double top, Adam and Eve double top, or Adam and Eve double bottom patterns present. Price action has been relatively range-bound, and while volume has been increasing slightly, it is not significant enough to confirm a trend. Support and resistance levels are currently around 178 and 181 respectively, and the price is hovering near the middle of this range. Therefore, a neutral stance is advised until further price action or volume provides a clearer signal.</td>

<tr>
    <td>ASML</td>
    <td>Sell</td>
    <td>The price has been in a downtrend since 04/06/2022, with lower highs and lower lows. There was a key reversal on 04/01/2024, where the price made a higher high but closed near the low of the day, indicating selling pressure. Additionally, volume has been increasing on down days, which is a bearish sign. There is also a potential inverse head and shoulders pattern, but the right shoulder has not yet been formed, and a break below the neckline would confirm a bearish outlook.</td>
</tr>

<tr>
    <td>AVGO</td>
    <td>Sell</td>
    <td>The price has been in a downtrend since 2024-03-28, with lower highs and lower lows. On 2024-04-02, there was a key reversal day with a long wick on the top candle, indicating selling pressure. Additionally, the volume on this day was higher than the previous day, which confirms the selling. The price has also broken below a support level of around 1320, which could indicate further downside. Therefore, a sell recommendation is warranted.</td>

<tr>
    <td>BAC</td>
    <td>Neutral</td>
    <td>The price has been in a downtrend since April 4, 2022, with no clear signs of reversal. There are no head and shoulders, inverse head and shoulders, double bottom, double top, Adam and Eve double top, or Adam and Eve double bottom patterns present in the data. The volume has not shown any significant increase during the price declines, which suggests a lack of strong buying or selling interest. The close price on April 2, 2024, is slightly above the low of the period, indicating a possible weak support level, but it is not enough to justify a buy verdict. Therefore, the current analysis suggests a neutral stance.</td>
</tr>

<tr>
    <td>CCZ</td>
    <td>Neutral</td>
    <td>Based on the price data provided, there are no clear buy or sell signals using the given indicators. The price has been relatively stable, with only small fluctuations, and there are no clear patterns such as head and shoulders, double tops or bottoms, or key reversals. Additionally, volume has been consistently low, which suggests a lack of strong buying or selling pressure. Therefore, a neutral stance is recommended until there are more clear indications of a trend.</td>
</tr>

    <td>COST</td>
    <td>Buy</td>
    <td>The price has been in an uptrend since April 2022, with several higher highs and higher lows. Although the price experienced a minor pullback in the last few days, it found support around 710, which was a previous resistance level. This pullback could be a buying opportunity as the overall trend is still upwards. Additionally, the volume on the recent pullback has been lower than the volume during the uptrend, which is a bullish sign. Therefore, a buy verdict is recommended.</td>

There have been no clear bullish patterns such as key reversals, double bottoms, or inverse head and shoulders. Additionally, volume has not been particularly high on the recent rallies, which suggests a lack of buying pressure. On the other hand, there have been no clear bearish patterns such as head and shoulders or double tops. The price has found some support around the 49.50 level, but it's unclear if this will hold. Therefore, a neutral stance is recommended until there are more clear signs of a trend reversal.</td>

    <td>Based on the provided data, there are no clear buy or sell signals from the indicators we are considering. Price action does not show any significant trends or patterns. There is some volatility in the data, but it does not appear to be consistently increasing or decreasing. There do not appear to be any clear support or resistance levels in the data. Prices have fluctuated within a range, but there are no obvious levels where the price has consistently bounced back or been held down. There are no head and shoulders, inverse head and shoulders, key reversals, double bottoms, double tops, Adam and Eve double tops, or Adam and Eve double bottoms present in the data. Volume has not shown any significant increases or decreases that might suggest a change in market sentiment. Therefore, based on the available data and the indicators we are considering, our analysis is neutral.</td>

Price action has been relatively range-bound, and while volume has been increasing, it is not at an extreme level that would suggest a significant trend change. Support and resistance levels are currently around 140 and 155 respectively, but without a clear trend or pattern, it is difficult to make a definitive recommendation. Therefore, a neutral stance is advised.</td>

    <td>JPM</td>
    <td>Buy</td>
    <td>Based on the price data provided, we can identify a potential inverse head and shoulders pattern, which is typically a bullish signal. The "head" of the pattern occurred on 2024-03-27 with a high of 199.600006, surrounded by two "shoulders" on 2024-03-26 (196.660004) and 2024-03-28 (200.720001). The "neckline" of the pattern can be drawn along the support level around 195. The price broke above this neckline on 2024-04-01, indicating a potential buy opportunity. Additionally, volume increased during the formation of the right shoulder and the breakout, which further supports this analysis.</td>

There are no significant key reversals, double tops, double bottoms, or head and shoulders patterns. Price action has been relatively range-bound, with support and resistance levels around 60-64. Volume has not shown any significant spikes or trends. Therefore, a neutral stance is advised until a clearer trend emerges.</td>

    <td>Neutral</td>
    <td>The price has been in a general uptrend since April 2022, but there are no clear bullish patterns such as key reversals, double bottoms, or inverse head and shoulders in the recent data. There is also no clear resistance level to indicate a sell opportunity. However, the price has been fluctuating in a relatively narrow range for the past few days, which suggests a lack of momentum and a potential for a correction. Therefore, a neutral stance is recommended until there are clearer signals.</td>

    <td>LLY</td>
    <td>Neutral</td>
    <td>The price has been in an uptrend since April 2022, but has recently formed a double top pattern with a peak at 778.33 on March 26 and 785.26 on March 27, 2024. This pattern often indicates a reversal in trend. However, volume has not confirmed this reversal, as it has not increased significantly during the formation of the double top. Additionally, the price has not yet broken below the neckline of the pattern at around 760. The RSI is also not yet showing oversold conditions. Therefore, it is best to remain neutral until further confirmation of a trend reversal.</td>

The price has been generally increasing since April 2022, but there are no clear patterns or reversals in the recent data. Additionally, volume has not been particularly high around the most recent price changes, which suggests a lack of strong conviction from buyers or sellers. Therefore, a neutral stance is advised.</td>

    <td>MCD</td>
    <td>Buy</td>
    <td>The price has been in an uptrend since April 2022, with higher highs and higher lows. Although the price has been fluctuating in the past few days, the overall trend remains bullish. There is a support level around 277-278, which has been tested several times and held. The volume has been decreasing during the fluctuations, which could indicate a potential breakout soon. Therefore, I would recommend a "buy" strategy with a stop loss around 276 and a target profit around 285.</td>

There was a double bottom pattern formed on 2024-03-27 and 2024-03-28, which was confirmed when the price broke above the resistance level of 500. The volume has been increasing during the recent rallies, indicating strong buying pressure. Therefore, I would recommend a "buy" verdict.</td>

The price has broken above the resistance level of 130.00, indicating a potential continuation of the uptrend. The volume has been decreasing during the recent pullback, which could indicate a lack of sellers and a potential for the uptrend to continue. Additionally, the price has formed an inverse head and shoulders pattern, which is a bullish pattern that often indicates a reversal in trend. Therefore, a buy verdict is recommended.</td>

    <td>The price has been in an uptrend since April 2022, with several key reversals and higher highs and lows. However, the most recent candlestick on April 2, 2024, shows a potential double top pattern with a high of 69.779999 and a previous high of 69.760002 on March 31, 2024. The double top pattern is a bearish reversal pattern, but it has not been confirmed yet as we need to see a break below the neckline, which is around 67.040001. Therefore, it is better to wait for a confirmation before making any trading decisions. The volume has been decreasing in the recent candlesticks, which is another bearish sign. However, the volume spike on April 2, 2024, could be a bullish sign if it is followed by a break above the recent high. Overall, the price action is indicating a potential reversal, but it is not yet confirmed. Therefore, a neutral stance is recommended until there is a clearer signal.</td>
