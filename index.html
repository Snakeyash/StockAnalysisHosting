  <td>Buy</td>
  <td>The stock price has been in an uptrend since 2022-03-29, with a series of higher highs and higher lows. On 2024-03-28, the stock formed a key reversal day, with a higher high and a close above the previous day's high, indicating strong buying pressure. Additionally, the stock has broken above a resistance level around 180, which had previously acted as a barrier to further price increases. These factors suggest that the stock is likely to continue its uptrend, making it a good buy candidate.</td>

  <td>ACN</td>
  <td>Buy</td>
  <td>Based on the price action and technical analysis, the stock has been in an uptrend since 2022-03-29 with higher highs and higher lows. On 2024-03-25, a bullish engulfing pattern was observed, where the body of the candle completely engulfs the previous candle's body, indicating a potential trend reversal or a strong buying pressure. Additionally, the stock closed near the high of the day on 2024-03-28, which can be interpreted as a bullish sign. Lastly, the volume on 2024-03-28 was significantly higher than the previous days, suggesting a strong interest from investors. Therefore, considering these factors, a 'buy' verdict is recommended.</td>

On 2024-03-25, there was a bullish engulfing pattern, where the body of the candle completely covered the previous candle's body, indicating a potential trend reversal or continuation. Additionally, the volume on that day was higher than the previous day, which could indicate buying pressure. Therefore, a buy verdict is recommended.</td>

  <td>The stock has been in a downtrend since 2022-03-29, with lower highs and lower lows. There have been several key reversals, double tops, and a head and shoulders pattern indicating a bearish outlook. Additionally, volume has been decreasing during the rallies, which is a bearish sign. The stock closed below its support level on 2024-03-28, providing further evidence for a sell recommendation.</td>

  <td>AVGO</td>
  <td>Neutral</td>
  <td>The data provided does not contain clear patterns such as head and shoulders, inverse head and shoulders, key reversals, double bottom, double top, Adam and Eve double top, or Adam and Eve double bottom. Price action and volume do not provide clear buy or sell signals on their own. Support and resistance levels cannot be accurately determined without additional context.</td>

  <td>AZN</td>
  <td>Neutral</td>
  <td>The data provided covers a significant time period and does not show any clear patterns or indicators that would suggest a buy or sell position.

The price has been generally decreasing, but there is no clear support or resistance level.

  <td>COST</td>
  <td>Buy</td>
  <td>Based on the price action and volume, the stock has been in an uptrend since 2022-03-29 with consistently higher highs and higher lows. There have been several key reversals with higher volume, indicating strong buying interest. Additionally, the stock has formed a double bottom pattern on 2024-03-25 and 2024-03-26, which has been a bullish signal in the past. The stock has broken above the neckline of this pattern, which is another bullish sign. Therefore, I recommend a buy with a target price of 740 and a stop loss at 728.</td>
</tr>

<tr>
  <td>CRM</td>
  <td>Sell</td>
  <td>The stock price has been in a downtrend since 2024-03-25, with lower highs and lower lows. Additionally, the most recent candlestick on 2024-03-28 is a bearish engulfing pattern, which occurs when a small white candlestick is followed by a large black candlestick that completely covers the body of the small white candlestick. This pattern is often seen as a bearish signal, indicating that the bears have taken control of the market. Furthermore, volume has been increasing as the price has been decreasing, which is another bearish sign. Therefore, I would recommend selling this stock.</td>
</tr>

<tr>
  <td>CSCO</td>
  <td>Neutral</td>
  <td>Based on the provided data, there are no clear patterns such as head and shoulders, inverse head and shoulders, double tops, double bottoms, or key reversals.

  <td>Sell</td>
  <td>The price has been in a downtrend since 2022-04-04, with lower highs and lower lows. Additionally, the most recent candlestick is a bearish engulfing pattern, which indicates a potential reversal in trend and is often a bearish signal. Furthermore, volume has been increasing as the price has been decreasing, which is another bearish signal. Therefore, I would recommend selling.</td>
</tr>

<tr>
  <td>FMX</td>
  <td>Buy</td>
  <td>Based on the price action and volume, the stock has been in an uptrend since 2022-03-29, with higher highs and higher lows. There have been several key reversals, with the price bouncing off the support level around 82.00. Additionally, the stock has formed a double bottom pattern around the same support level, which is a bullish signal. The volume has been increasing during the uptrend, which is a positive sign. Therefore, I would recommend a buy rating for this stock.</td>
</tr>

  <td>GOOG</td>
  <td>Neutral</td>
  <td>Based on the provided data, there are no clear patterns such as head and shoulders, inverse head and shoulders, key reversals, double bottom, double top, Adam and Eve double top, or Adam and Eve double bottom. While there is a general downward trend in support and resistance levels from 2022-03-29 to 2024-03-28, it is not significant enough to make a definitive "buy" or "sell" recommendation. Additionally, volume data is not sufficient to make a determination based on that factor alone.</td>
</tr>

<tr>
  <td>GOOGL</td>
  <td>Neutral</td>
  <td>The provided data only includes price and volume, making it difficult to identify specific patterns such as head and shoulders, key reversals, double bottom, double top, Adam and Eve double top, and Adam and Eve double bottom. While there is a general upward trend in price and some support and resistance levels can be identified, a more detailed analysis would be needed to make a buy or sell recommendation.</td>

  <td>Based on the provided data, there are no clear patterns such as head and shoulders, inverse head and shoulders, key reversals, double bottom, double top, Adam and Eve double top, or Adam and Eve double bottom. While there is some price action and support and resistance that could be interpreted, the data provided is not sufficient to make a confident buy or sell decision. Therefore, a neutral verdict is given.</td>
</tr>

<tr>
  <td>JPM</td>
  <td>Neutral</td>
  <td>The provided data only goes through 2024-03-28, so it's difficult to provide a verdict based on classic chart patterns like head and shoulders, inverse head and shoulders, double bottom, double top, Adam and Eve double top, and Adam and Eve double bottom. Price action, support and resistance, key reversals, and volume analysis would require more data to make an informed decision.</td>
</tr>

<tr>
  <td>KO</td>
  <td>Neutral</td>
  <td>Based on the provided historical price data, there are no clear patterns such as head and shoulders, inverse head and shoulders, key reversals, double bottom, double top, Adam and Eve double top, Adam and Eve double bottom, or significant volume changes that would typically trigger a buy or sell recommendation. The price has been generally range-bound between 60 and 63 over the past few months. Therefore, a neutral stance is advised.</td>
</tr>

<tr>
  <td>LIN</td>
  <td>Neutral</td>
  <td>The data provided covers a significant time period, and making a buy or sell decision based solely on this data would not be prudent. However, there are a few potential patterns that could be noted for future reference. For instance, there seems to be a support level around 320 and resistance around 330 in the earlier part of the data. Additionally, there is a potential inverse head and shoulders pattern around the end of the data. But a confirmation of these patterns would require more data and analysis.</td>
</tr>

<tr>
  <td>LLY</td>
  <td>Buy</td>
  <td>Based on the price action and volume, the stock has been in an uptrend since 2022-03-29 with consistently higher highs and higher lows. On 2024-03-27, there was a bullish engulfing pattern where the body of the candle completely covered the previous candle's body, indicating a potential trend reversal or continuation. This pattern was accompanied by an increase in volume, adding to its significance. Therefore, a buy verdict is recommended.</td>
</tr>

<tr>
  <td>MA</td>
  <td>Buy</td>
  <td>Based on the price action and volume, the stock has been in an uptrend since 2022-03-29 with higher highs and higher lows. On 2024-03-28, there was a bullish key reversal pattern with a higher low and a higher close compared to the previous day. Additionally, the volume on that day was higher than the previous day, indicating strong buying interest. These factors suggest a buy signal for the stock.</td>
</tr>

<tr>
  <td>NFLX</td>
  <td>Neutral</td>
  <td>Based on the provided data, there are no clear patterns or indicators for buying or selling. There is no evidence of head and shoulders, inverse head and shoulders, key reversals, double bottom, double top, Adam and Eve double top, or Adam and Eve double bottom. Price action has been relatively steady, with some ups and downs, but no clear trends. Support and resistance levels are not explicitly provided, and volume has not shown any significant spikes or drops. Therefore, a neutral verdict is given.</td>
</tr>

<tr>
  <td>NVDA</td>
  <td>Sell</td>
  <td>The stock has been in a consistent downward trend since 2022-04-01, with lower highs and lower lows. Additionally, the volume has been increasing as the price has been decreasing, which is a bearish sign. There are also no bullish patterns such as a double bottom or inverse head and shoulders present. Therefore, I would recommend selling this stock.</td>
</tr>

<tr>
  <td>NVO</td>
  <td>Buy</td>
  <td>The stock price has been in an uptrend since 2022-03-29, with a series of higher highs and higher lows. On 2024-03-26, the stock made a key reversal day, closing near the high of the day on higher than average volume. This is a bullish sign and suggests that the uptrend is likely to continue. Additionally, the stock has formed a double bottom pattern on the daily chart, with support at around 128.00. The recent break above the neckline of this pattern provides further evidence of a potential uptrend. Therefore, I would recommend a buy verdict at the current price.</td>
</tr>

<tr>
  <td>ORCL</td>
  <td>Neutral</td>
  <td>Based on the provided data, there are no clear patterns or signals for buying or selling. There is no significant volume increase, and the price has been in a relatively narrow range. There is no evidence of support or resistance levels, head and shoulders, key reversals, double bottoms or tops, Adam and Eve patterns. Therefore, a neutral position is recommended.</td>
</tr>

  <td>PEP</td>
  <td>Neutral</td>
  <td>Based on the provided data, there are no clear patterns or indicators suggesting to buy or sell. There are no head and shoulders, inverse head and shoulders, double tops, double bottoms, or key reversals present. While there is some resistance around the 175 level, it has not been tested sufficiently to confirm it as a strong resistance level. Additionally, volume has not been particularly high during the recent price moves, which suggests a lack of conviction from buyers or sellers. Therefore, a neutral stance is recommended until further price action or patterns emerge.</td>
</tr>

<tr>
  <td>PG</td>
  <td>Neutral</td>
  <td>Based on the provided data, there are no clear patterns or indicators for buying or selling. There are no head and shoulders, inverse head and shoulders, double tops, double bottoms, or key reversals visible. Price action has been relatively range-bound, with support and resistance around 152 and 156 respectively, but this is not a strong enough signal to make a buy or sell decision. Volume has not shown any significant spikes or patterns that would suggest a change in trend. Therefore, a neutral stance is recommended.</td>
</tr>

<tr>
  <td>SAP</td>
  <td>Neutral</td>
  <td>The data provided covers a significant time period, and making a verdict based solely on price action, support and resistance, and volume would require a more detailed analysis of the trends within this time frame. A 'neutral' verdict is given due to the limited context provided.</td>
</tr>

<tr>
  <td>SHEL</td>
  <td>Buy</td>
  <td>Based on the price action and technical analysis, the stock has been in an uptrend since 2022-03-29 with higher highs and higher lows. On 2024-03-25, there was a bullish engulfing pattern (key reversal), where the body of the candle completely covered the previous candle, indicating a potential trend reversal or a strong buying pressure. Additionally, the stock has broken above the resistance level of 67.00, which can be seen as a bullish sign. Therefore, a buy verdict is recommended.</td>

  <td>TM</td>
  <td>Neutral</td>
  <td>Based on the given data, there are no clear patterns such as head and shoulders, inverse head and shoulders, double bottom, double top, Adam and Eve double top, Adam and Eve double bottom, or key reversals. The price has been generally trending upwards, but there are no clear support or resistance levels. Volume has been relatively low and inconsistent, making it difficult to make a decision based on that as well.</td>
</tr>

<tr>
  <td>TMO</td>
  <td>Buy</td>
  <td>Based on the price action and volume, the stock has been in an uptrend since 2022-03-29 with higher highs and higher lows. Although there was a pullback on 2024-03-26, the stock quickly recovered and closed above the previous day's high. This is a bullish sign and suggests that buyers are in control. Additionally, the volume on the recovery day was significantly higher than the previous day, indicating strong buying interest. Therefore, a buy verdict is recommended.</td>
</tr>

<tr>
  <td>TSLA</td>
  <td>Neutral</td>
  <td>The provided data only includes daily open, high, low, close, and volume values, but it does not contain any specific patterns or indicators that would trigger a buy or sell verdict based solely on price action, support and resistance, head and shoulders, inverse head and shoulder, key reversals, double bottom, double top, Adam and Eve double top, Adam and Eve double bottom, or volume. Additional analysis or technical indicators would be required to make an informed decision.</td>

Price action and support and resistance levels cannot be determined without a specific time frame and context.</td>
</tr>

<tr>
  <td>UNH</td>
  <td>Neutral</td>
  <td>The data provided covers a significant time period and includes many data points. Using the techniques specified, I do not see any clear buy or sell signals. There are no obvious head and shoulders, inverse head and shoulders, double tops, double bottoms, or key reversals. Price action has been relatively range-bound, with support and resistance around the 490 and 520 levels, respectively. Volume has not been particularly noteworthy. Therefore, a neutral stance is advised.</td>

  <td>V</td>
  <td>Sell</td>
  <td>The stock price has been forming a descending head and shoulders pattern since 2022-04-01, with the left shoulder at 226.63, the head at 229.24, and the right shoulder at 225.76. The "neckline" of this pattern is the support level at around 220.47 (the lowest low between the shoulders). A breakdown below this neckline would indicate a bearish reversal and a potential sell opportunity.</td>

  <td>WFC</td>
  <td>Neutral</td>
  <td>Based on the provided data, there are no clear patterns such as head and shoulders, inverse head and shoulders, double bottom, double top, Adam and Eve double top, Adam and Eve double bottom, or key reversals. The price has been generally trending upwards, but there have been some recent decreases in price. Support and resistance levels are not explicitly provided, and volume does not show any significant spikes that would indicate a change in trend. Therefore, a neutral verdict is given.</td>

  <td>WMT</td>
  <td>Buy</td>
  <td>The stock price has been in an uptrend since 2022-03-29, with a series of higher highs and higher lows. On 2024-03-25, there was a key reversal day with a higher low and a lower high, which can be a sign of weakness. However, the stock price quickly recovered and made a new high on 2024-03-27, which invalidated the bearish signal. The volume has been increasing during the uptrend, which is a bullish sign. Therefore, I recommend buying the stock.</td>
</tr>

<tr>
  <td>XOM</td>
  <td>Buy</td>
  <td>Based on the price action and volume data provided, the stock price has been in an overall uptrend, with higher highs and higher lows. There are also several bullish patterns present, including a potential inverse head and shoulders pattern (formed by the lows on 2022-04-01, 2022-06-15, and 2023-03-15) and a possible double bottom pattern (formed by the lows on 2022-07-06 and 2023-02-03). These patterns suggest that the stock may continue to rise in the near future. Additionally, the volume has been increasing on up days, which is a bullish sign. Therefore, I would recommend a 'buy' verdict for this stock.</td>

    <td>MCD</td>
    <td>Buy</td>
    <td>Based on the price action and volume, the stock has been in an uptrend since 2022-03-29 with consistently higher highs and higher lows. There are also higher volume spikes on the up days, indicating buying pressure. Although there was a small pullback on 2024-03-25, the stock quickly recovered and made a new high, which is a bullish sign. Therefore, I would recommend a 'buy' verdict.</td>
</tr>

<tr>
    <td>META</td>
    <td>Sell</td>
    <td>The stock price has been forming a double top pattern with the two recent highs of approximately 234 and 229. This pattern suggests a potential reversal in the trend and a possible downward movement. Additionally, volume has been decreasing as the price approached the second high, which can also be a bearish signal. However, it's important to note that these patterns are not always 100% accurate and should be used in conjunction with other forms of analysis.</td>

<tr>
    <td>MRK</td>
    <td>Buy</td>
    <td>Based on the price action and volume, the stock has been in an uptrend since 2022-03-29 with consistently higher highs and higher lows. There are also higher volume spikes on the up days, indicating strong buying interest. Although there was a pullback on 2024-03-22, the stock found support at the previous resistance-turned-support level around 124.08, forming a double bottom pattern. This is a bullish reversal pattern, and the subsequent break above the neckline (126.08) on 2024-03-26 further confirms the buy signal. The price target for this pattern is approximately 133.10, which is the height of the pattern added to the breakout level (133.10 = 126.08 + (125.58 - 124.08)).</td>
</tr>

    <td>MSFT</td>
    <td>Neutral</td>

However, it does not contain any clear patterns such as support and resistance levels, head and shoulders, key reversals, double bottoms or double tops. Therefore, it is difficult to make a buy or sell recommendation based solely on this data. It is always recommended to conduct a more comprehensive analysis before making any investment decisions.</td>
