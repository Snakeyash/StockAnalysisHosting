    <td>Neutral</td>
    <td>Based on the provided data, there are no clear buy or sell signals from the indicators I can analyze (price action, support and resistance, head and shoulders, inverse head and shoulder, key reversals, double bottom, double top, Adam and Eve double top, Adam and Eve double bottom, and volume). The price has been in a relatively narrow range for the past few months, with no clear trends or significant reversals. Additionally, there are no obvious support or resistance levels, and the volume has not shown any significant increases or decreases. Therefore, I would recommend a neutral position until there are more clear indications of a trend.</td>

<tr>
    <td>ABBV</td>
    <td>Buy</td>
    <td>Based on the price data provided, the stock has been in an uptrend since April 2022, with higher highs and higher lows. Although the stock experienced a slight pullback in the last few days, it still remains above the support level of 178.53 (the highest low before the uptrend started). Additionally, the stock formed a "double bottom" pattern on March 25-26, which is a bullish reversal pattern. The volume also increased during the formation of this pattern, adding more confidence to the bullish outlook. Therefore, I would recommend a "buy" verdict.</td>
</tr><tr>
    <td>ACN</td>
    <td>Neutral</td>
    <td>Based on the provided data, there are no clear buy or sell signals from the technical indicators we are considering. There is no evidence of key reversals, double bottom, double top, Adam and Eve double top, or Adam and Eve double bottom patterns. Price action has been relatively range-bound, with support and resistance around 330 and 345 respectively, and volume has not shown any significant increase or decrease. Therefore, a neutral stance is advised.</td>
</tr><tr>
    <td>ADBE</td>
    <td>Neutral</td>
    <td>The price has been in a general uptrend since April 2022, but there are no clear bullish or bearish patterns in the recent data. There is some resistance around 510, which was tested on March 25 and 26, but the price was able to break through on March 27. However, volume has been decreasing since March 25, which could indicate a lack of buying pressure. Additionally, there is a support level around 500, which was tested on April 1, but held. Without clearer signals, it is best to maintain a neutral position.</td>
</tr><tr>
    <td>AMD</td>
    <td>Sell</td>
    <td>The price has been in an uptrend, but on the last day of trading (01/04/2024), there was a key reversal pattern with a higher high followed by a lower close. Additionally, volume on this day was significantly higher than the previous day, indicating strong selling pressure. This suggests that the uptrend may be coming to an end and it could be a good time to sell.</td>
</tr><tr>
<td>AMZN</td>
<td>Neutral</td>
<td>Based on the provided data, there are no clear buy or sell signals from the indicators we are considering. There is no head and shoulders, inverse head and shoulder, key reversals, double bottom, double top, Adam and Eve double top, or Adam and Eve double bottom patterns present. Price action has been relatively range-bound, and while volume has been increasing slightly, it is not significant enough to confirm a trend. Support and resistance levels are not clearly defined in this range. Therefore, a neutral stance is advised until further price action provides a clearer signal.</td>
</tr><tr>
<td>ASML</td>
<td>Sell</td>
<td>The price has formed an inverse head and shoulders pattern, indicating a potential trend reversal from bearish to bullish. However, the price has broken down from the neckline support, confirming the continuation of the downtrend. Additionally, the recent price action shows a key reversal on high volume, further supporting a sell decision.</td>
</tr><tr>
<td>AVGO</td>
<td>Sell</td>
<td>The price has been in an uptrend, but on 04/01/2024, there was a key reversal day with a higher high and a lower close, which is a bearish signal. Additionally, volume on this day was above average, which can indicate strong selling pressure. The price has also reached a resistance level around 1360, which could provide further resistance to any upward movement. Therefore, a sell recommendation is made.</td>
</tr><tr>
<td>AZN</td>
<td>Neutral</td>
<td>The price has been in a general downtrend since 04/08/2022, but there are no clear reversal patterns such as head and shoulders, inverse head and shoulders, key reversals, double bottom, double top, Adam and Eve double top, or Adam and Eve double bottom. The volume has not shown any significant spikes or drops that would indicate a change in trend. Therefore, a neutral position is recommended until clearer patterns emerge.</td>
</tr><tr>
<td>BAC</td>
<td>Neutral</td>
<td>The price has been in a downtrend since April 4, 2022, with no clear signs of reversal or support. There are no head and shoulders, inverse head and shoulders, key reversals, double bottom, double top, Adam and Eve double top, or Adam and Eve double bottom patterns present in the data. Volume has not been particularly notable during this time period. Therefore, it is difficult to make a definitive buy or sell recommendation based solely on this price data.</td>
</tr><tr>
<td>CCZ</td>
<td>Neutral</td>
<td>Based on the provided data, there are no clear buy or sell signals from the indicators I can analyze. There are no signs of key reversals, double bottoms, double tops, head and shoulders, or inverse head and shoulders. Price action has been relatively sideways, with support and resistance around 56.00. Volume has been low and inconsistent, which doesn't provide any clear insights. Therefore, I would recommend a neutral position until there are more clear signals.</td>
</tr><tr>
<td>COST</td>
<td>Neutral</td>
<td>The price has been in a steady uptrend since April 2022, with no clear bearish patterns such as head and shoulders, double tops, or key reversals. However, the price has been ranging between 720 and 735 for the past few days, indicating a potential consolidation phase. Therefore, it may be best to wait for a clear breakout or breakdown before making a trading decision.</td>
</tr><tr>
<td>CRM</td>
<td>Sell</td>
<td>The price has been in a downtrend since 04/04/2022, with lower highs and lower lows. There have been several key reversals, with the price failing to break above the previous high. The most recent reversal occurred on 04/01/2024, where the price reached a high of 303.51 but closed below the previous day's close at 302.26. This is a bearish sign and suggests that the downtrend is likely to continue. Additionally, volume has been decreasing during this time period, which is often a sign of decreasing interest and a weakening trend. Therefore, I would recommend selling at this time.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>CSCO</td>
<td>Neutral</td>
<td>Based on the provided data, there are no clear buy or sell signals from the indicators I can use. Price has been in a downtrend since April 2022, but there have not been any clear key reversals, double bottom, double top, Adam and Eve double top, or Adam and Eve double bottom patterns. Support and resistance levels are not clearly defined in this range. Volume has not shown any significant increase or decrease that would indicate a change in trend. Therefore, I would recommend a neutral position until there are more clear signals.</td>

<td>Neutral</td>
<td>Based on the provided data, there are no clear buy or sell signals from the given indicators. There is no head and shoulders, inverse head and shoulder, key reversals, double bottom, double top, Adam and Eve double top, or Adam and Eve double bottom patterns present. Price action has been relatively range-bound, and volume has not shown any significant increase or decrease. Support and resistance levels are not explicitly provided, but based on the given data, there are no clear levels to watch for a breakout. Therefore, a neutral stance is advised until further analysis or a clearer signal emerges.</td>

<td>DIS</td>
<td>Neutral</td>
<td>Based on the provided data, there are no clear buy or sell signals from the indicators we are considering. There is no evidence of key reversals, double bottom, double top, Adam and Eve double top or bottom, or head and shoulders patterns. Price action has been relatively sideways, and while volume has been somewhat elevated recently, it is not enough to confirm a trend. Support and resistance levels are currently around 119 and 122 respectively, but without a clear trend, it is difficult to make a definitive recommendation. Therefore, a neutral stance is advised.</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>FMX</td>
<td>Neutral</td>
<td>Based on the provided data, there are no clear buy or sell signals from the indicators I can use. There is no evidence of head and shoulders, inverse head and shoulders, key reversals, double bottom, double top, Adam and Eve double top, or Adam and Eve double bottom patterns. Price action has been relatively sideways, and while volume increased on 2024-03-26, it has since decreased and is not at a level that would typically indicate a strong trend. Support and resistance levels are also not clearly defined in this range. Therefore, a neutral position is recommended.</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>GOOG</td>
<td>Buy</td>
<td>The price has been in an uptrend since the beginning of the year, with several key reversals and a double bottom pattern in February indicating strong buying interest. Although there was a double top pattern in March, the price broke above it on April 1st, indicating a continuation of the uptrend. The volume has been increasing during the recent rallies, which is a bullish sign. Currently, the price is near the resistance level of 157, but if it breaks above this level, it could continue to rise towards the next resistance level around 165. Therefore, I recommend a buy position with a stop loss around 150 and a target price around 165.</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>GOOGL</td>
<td>Buy</td>
<td>The price has been in an uptrend since the beginning of the year, with several key reversals and a double bottom pattern in February indicating strong buying interest. The recent inverse head and shoulders pattern, confirmed by the break above the neckline around $151, is a bullish signal. Additionally, the volume has been increasing during the recent uptrend, which is a positive sign. Therefore, I would recommend a "buy" verdict.</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>HD</td>
<td>Neutral</td>
<td>The price has been in a general uptrend since April 2022, but there are no clear bullish patterns such as a double bottom or key reversals in the recent data. There is also no clear resistance level to indicate a sell opportunity. Therefore, a neutral position is recommended until there are more clear signals.</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>JNJ</td>
<td>Sell</td>
<td>The price has been in a downtrend since April 2022, with several key reversals and lower highs and lows. The volume has also been decreasing during this time period, which is a bearish sign. Additionally, there is a double top pattern formed in March 2024, with the two peaks at around 159 and 158, and the neckline at around 155. This pattern is a strong bearish signal, and a breakdown below the neckline would confirm the pattern and suggest further downside. Therefore, I would recommend selling.</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>JPM</td>
<td>Buy</td>
<td>The price has been in an uptrend since the beginning of the year, with several key reversals and a double bottom pattern in February indicating strong buying interest. Although there was a slight pullback in the last few days, the price found support around 195, which is a strong indication of continued bullish sentiment. Additionally, volume has been increasing during the rallies, which is a positive sign. Therefore, I would recommend a buy position with a stop loss around 194.</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>KO</td>
<td>Neutral</td>
<td>The price data from 04/04/2022 to 04/01/2024 does not show any clear patterns or indicators for buying or selling. There are no significant key reversals, double tops, double bottoms, head and shoulders, or inverse head and shoulders visible. Price action has been relatively range-bound, with support and resistance levels around 60-62 and 63-64. Volume has not been particularly high during this period, and there is no clear trend. Therefore, a neutral stance is recommended.</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>LIN</td>
<td>Neutral</td>
<td>Based on the provided data, there are no clear buy or sell signals from the technical indicators we are considering. There is no evidence of key reversals, double bottoms, double tops, head and shoulders, or inverse head and shoulders patterns. Price action has been relatively range-bound, with support and resistance around 460 and 470 respectively. Volume has not been significantly higher or lower on any of the days, so it does not provide any clear indication either. Therefore, a neutral stance is advised.</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>LLY</td>
<td>Buy</td>
<td>The price has been in an uptrend since April 2022, with higher highs and higher lows. Although the price experienced a small correction in the last few days, it found support around 760, which is a positive sign.

</tr>

<tr>
<td>MA</td>
<td>Neutral</td>
<td>The price has been in an overall uptrend since April 2022, but there are no clear bullish or bearish patterns in the recent data. There is some resistance around 482, which was tested on March 27 and April 1, but there were no significant key reversals or volume spikes to suggest a trend change. Additionally, there is no clear support or resistance level that has been broken recently. Therefore, it is best to maintain a neutral position until there are more clear signals.</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>MCD</td>
<td>Buy</td>
<td>The price has been in an uptrend since April 2022, with higher highs and higher lows. Although the price experienced a slight pullback in the last few days, the overall trend remains bullish. The price found support around 278, which is a strong support level. The volume has been decreasing during the pullback, which indicates a lack of selling pressure. Therefore, I would recommend a "buy" strategy, targeting a higher price level while managing the risk with a proper stop loss.</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>META</td>
<td>Sell</td>
<td>The price has been in a downtrend since 01/04/2024, with a series of lower highs and lower lows. On 01/04/2024, there was a key reversal day with a long wick on the daily candle, indicating selling pressure. Additionally, the price has broken down below a support level around 490, which could provide further evidence of a downtrend. The volume on the break down was also higher than average, which can be a sign of strong selling. Therefore, a sell verdict is recommended.</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>MRK</td>
<td>Buy</td>
<td>The price has been in an uptrend since April 2022, with several key reversals and higher highs and higher lows. The most recent candle (2024-04-01) is a bullish engulfing candle, which indicates a potential trend reversal to the upside. Additionally, the price has found support at the 50-day moving average (not provided in the data), which is a positive sign. Therefore, I would recommend a buy position.</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>MSFT</td>
<td>Buy</td>
<td>The price has been in an uptrend since the beginning of the year, with several key reversals and a double bottom pattern in February indicating strong buying interest. Although there was a slight pullback in the last few days, the price found support around 420, which is a strong indication of continued bullish sentiment. The volume has been decreasing during the pullback, which suggests that this could be a healthy correction before the uptrend resumes. Therefore, I recommend a buy position.</td>

<td>The price has been in a downtrend since 2022-04-04, with lower highs and lower lows. There was a key reversal on 2024-03-28, where the price made a higher high but closed near the low of the day, indicating selling pressure. Additionally, volume has been increasing on down days, which is a bearish sign. There is also a potential inverse head and shoulders pattern, but the right shoulder has not yet been formed, and a break below the neckline would confirm a bearish outlook. Therefore, I would recommend selling.</td>
</tr>

The price has been in an uptrend since April 2022, but there have been some minor corrections along the way.

</tr>

<tr>
<td>PEP</td>
<td>Neutral</td>
<td>The price has been in an uptrend since April 2022, but there are no clear reversal patterns or significant volume spikes in the recent data. The price has been hovering around the 173-175 range for the past few days. Without a clear signal of a reversal or continuation, it is best to maintain a neutral position.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>PG</td>
<td>Buy</td>
<td>Based on the price data provided, the closing price on the last day (01/04/2024) is slightly lower than the previous day, but still within the recent range. However, the overall trend has been positive with higher highs and higher lows since April 2022. There are no clear bearish patterns such as head and shoulders or double tops. Additionally, the volume has been decreasing as the price approached the most recent low, which could indicate a lack of sell pressure. Therefore, a buy verdict is recommended, with a potential target price at the recent high of around 163.14 (on 2024-03-28) and a stop loss at the most recent low of around 159.80 (on 2024-04-01).</td>

Price action over the past two years has been generally trending upwards, with a few corrections along the way.

There are no head and shoulders, inverse head and shoulders, key reversals, double bottoms, double tops, Adam and Eve double tops, or Adam and Eve double bottoms visible in the data.
