<td>Sell</td>
<td>On 04/04/2024, the stock price closed at 180.000000, which is a key reversal day with a long wick on the top candle and a lower close than the open price. This is a bearish signal. Additionally, the price has broken down below the support level of 182.50, which was previous resistance.

<td>The stock price has been in a downtrend since April 6, 2022, with a series of lower highs and lower lows. On April 5, 2024, the stock formed a double top pattern with a resistance level around 153.01. The stock closed below this level on April 4, 2024, confirming the double top pattern.

The volume on the selling days (04/04/2024 and 04/05/2024) is also higher than the volume on the days when the stock price reached the double top. This indicates a potential downtrend and it would be advisable to sell.</td>

  <td>Sell</td>
  <td>The stock price has been in a downtrend since 04/03/2024, with lower highs and lower lows.

Additionally, the closing price on 04/05/2024 is below the support level of 463.399994 (the closing price on 04/01/2024), providing further evidence of a potential downtrend.

On 04/04/2024, there was a bullish key reversal pattern, where the stock made a new high but closed near the low of the day, indicating selling pressure may be decreasing. Additionally, the volume on this day was above average, which can be a sign of institutional buying. The stock also found support at the previous resistance level of 140, which has now turned into support. These factors suggest a buy opportunity.</td>

  <td>The stock has been on a downward trend, with a key reversal on 04/02/2024 and a lower high on 04/05/2024. Additionally, the stock has broken below a support level around 460. Volume has also increased on the most recent drop, indicating strong selling pressure.</td>

This, combined with the lower volume on the most recent decline, suggests a downward trend. Additionally, the stock has broken through a key support level at 276.80 (the low of 04/03), increasing the likelihood of further declines.</td>
</tr>

<tr>
    <td>WFC</td>
    <td>Neutral</td>
    <td>Based on the provided data, there are no clear buy or sell signals from the technical indicators we are considering.

Price action over the past few days has been relatively sideways, with the stock trading within a range of about $1. This lack of a clear trend makes it difficult to make a definitive buy or sell recommendation.

In terms of support and resistance, the stock has found some support around the $56.50 level, with the stock bouncing off of this level on April 4th and again on April 5th. However, there is also resistance around the $58.00 level, which the stock has been unable to break through.

We do not see any clear head and shoulders, inverse head and shoulders, key reversals, double bottoms, double tops, Adam and Eve double tops, or Adam and Eve double bottoms in the data.

Finally, volume has been relatively low and inconsistent, which makes it difficult to use this indicator to confirm any potential buy or sell signals.</td>
</tr>

<tr>
    <td>WMT</td>
    <td>Neutral</td>
    <td>Based on the provided data, there are no clear buy or sell signals from the technical indicators we are considering.

Price action over the last few days has been relatively sideways, with the stock trading within a tight range of around $1. The stock did make a new high for the period on 2024-04-05, but it quickly pulled back, which suggests some resistance at the $60 level.

There are no clear support or resistance levels, as the stock has not been trading at these levels for a significant period of time.

There are no head and shoulders, inverse head and shoulders, double bottoms, double tops, Adam and Eve double tops, or Adam and Eve double bottoms visible in the data.

Volume has been decreasing over the last few days, which is not a particularly bullish or bearish sign. It's also worth noting that volume tends to be lower during weekends and around holidays, which could be a factor here.</td>

<td>XOM</td>

<td>Based on the provided data, there are no clear buy or sell signals from the technical indicators we are using. There is no head and shoulders, inverse head and shoulder, key reversals, double bottom, double top, Adam and Eve double top, or Adam and Eve double bottom patterns present.

  <td>The stock has been in a downtrend since April 12, 2022, with lower highs and lower lows. There is a double top pattern formed on April 2 and April 3, 2024, with a higher volume on the second top, which is a bearish signal. Additionally, the stock closed below its support level of 118 on April 5, 2024, which is a strong sell signal. Therefore, it is recommended to sell this stock.</td>

Price action has been relatively range-bound, and volume has not shown any significant increase or decrease. Support and resistance levels can be estimated to be around 125 and 130 respectively, but they have not been tested sufficiently to confirm them. Therefore, a neutral stance is advised until further price action provides a clearer signal.</td>

On the most recent day, 2024-04-05, the price made a new high above the previous high on 2024-04-04, indicating strong buying pressure. Additionally, the volume on 2024-04-05 was higher than the previous day, which confirms the strength of the uptrend.
