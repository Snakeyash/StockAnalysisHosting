  <td>ABBV</td>
  <td>Buy</td>
  <td>Based on the price action and volume, the stock has been in an uptrend since 2022-03-29 with consistently higher highs and higher lows. On 2024-03-28, the stock made a new high of 182.100006, surpassing the previous high of 164.660004, indicating a strong bullish trend. Additionally, the volume on 2024-03-28 was significantly higher than the previous days, indicating strong buying interest. Therefore, a buy verdict is recommended.</td>
</tr>

<tr>
  <td>ACN</td>
  <td>Neutral</td>
  <td>The data provided covers a significant time range, and making a verdict based solely on this data would require a more narrow time frame to accurately identify any specific patterns or trends. However, there are a few potential patterns that could be noted, such as a possible double top formation near the end of the data, but more data would be needed to confirm this.</td>
</tr>

<tr>
  <td>ADBE</td>
  <td>Buy</td>
  <td>Based on the price action and volume, the stock has been in an uptrend since 2022-04-01, with higher highs and higher lows. On 2024-03-25, there was a bullish engulfing pattern, where the body of the candle completely covered the previous candle's body, indicating a potential trend reversal or a strong buying pressure. Additionally, the volume on that day was significantly higher than the previous day, which confirms the strength of the bullish move. Therefore, a buy verdict is recommended.</td>
</tr>

<tr>
  <td>AMD</td>
  <td>Sell</td>
  <td>The price has been in an overall downtrend since 2022-03-29, with several lower highs and lower lows. On 2024-03-25, there was a bullish engulfing pattern, but the price was not able to break above the resistance level around 182. The volume on the recent rally has also been decreasing, which is a bearish sign. Therefore, it is recommended to sell.</td>

<tr>
  <td>ASML</td>

There is no evidence of a reversal pattern such as a head and shoulders, inverse head and shoulders, key reversals, double bottom, double top, Adam and Eve double top, or Adam and Eve double bottom. Additionally, volume has not increased significantly on the recent rallies, which would be a bullish sign. Therefore, based solely on price action, support and resistance, and volume, the stock appears to be in a downtrend and it would be advisable to sell.</td>
</tr>

<tr>
  <td>AVGO</td>
  <td>Neutral</td>
  <td>The data provided does not contain clear patterns such as head and shoulders, inverse head and shoulders, key reversals, double bottom, double top, Adam and Eve double top, or Adam and Eve double bottom. Price action and volume do not provide clear buy or sell signals on their own. Support and resistance levels cannot be accurately determined without additional context.</td>

<tr>
  <td>AZN</td>
  <td>Buy</td>
  <td>The stock has been in an uptrend since 2022-04-01, with a series of higher highs and higher lows. On 2024-03-27, the stock broke above a key resistance level at 68.379997, indicating a potential continuation of the uptrend. Additionally, volume has been increasing on the recent up days, which is a bullish sign. Therefore, I recommend a buy with a stop loss at 66.260002 (the breakout level) and a target price at 70 (the next resistance level).</td>
</tr>

<tr>
  <td>BAC</td>
  <td>Neutral</td>
  <td>Based on the provided data, there are no clear patterns such as head and shoulders, inverse head and shoulders, double bottom, double top, Adam and Eve double top, Adam and Eve double bottom, or key reversals. The price has been generally decreasing, but there is no clear support or resistance level. Volume has not been particularly high during recent price changes, so it does not provide a clear signal. Therefore, a neutral stance is recommended.</td>
</tr>

<tr>
  <td>CCZ</td>
  <td>Neutral</td>
  <td>Based on the provided data, there are no clear patterns or significant movements that would suggest a buy or sell opportunity using the technical indicators mentioned. The price has been relatively stable with low volume, and there are no head and shoulders, double tops/bottoms, or key reversals present. Therefore, a neutral position is recommended.</td>

  <td>Buy</td>
  <td>Based on the price action and volume, the stock has been in an uptrend since 2022-03-29 with consistently higher highs and higher lows. There have been several key reversals with higher volume, indicating strong buying interest. Additionally, the stock has formed a double bottom pattern on 2024-03-25 and 2024-03-26, which has been a bullish signal in the past. The stock has broken above the neckline of this pattern, which is another bullish sign. Therefore, I recommend a buy with a target price of 740 and a stop loss at 728.</td>
</tr>

<tr>
  <td>CRM</td>
  <td>Sell</td>
  <td>The stock price has been in a downtrend since 2024-03-25, with lower highs and lower lows. Additionally, the most recent candlestick on 2024-03-28 is a bearish engulfing pattern, which occurs when a small white candlestick is followed by a large black candlestick that completely covers the body of the small white candlestick. This pattern is often seen as a bearish signal, indicating that the bears have taken control of the market. Furthermore, volume has been increasing as the price has been decreasing, which is another bearish sign. Therefore, I would recommend selling this stock.</td>

<tr>
  <td>CSCO</td>
  <td>Neutral</td>
  <td>Based on the provided data, there are no clear patterns such as head and shoulders, inverse head and shoulders, double tops, double bottoms, or key reversals.

  <td>GOOG</td>
  <td>Neutral</td>
  <td>Based on the provided data, there are no clear patterns such as head and shoulders, inverse head and shoulders, key reversals, double bottom, double top, Adam and Eve double top, or Adam and Eve double bottom. While there is a general downward trend in support and resistance levels from 2022-03-29 to 2022-04-01, the trend reverses and becomes generally upward from 2022-04-04 to 2024-03-28. However, there are no clear price action or volume patterns that suggest a strong buy or sell signal.</td>
</tr>

<tr>
  <td>GOOGL</td>
  <td>Neutral</td>
  <td>The provided data only includes price and volume, making it difficult to identify specific patterns such as head and shoulders, key reversals, double bottom, double top, Adam and Eve double top, and Adam and Eve double bottom. While there is a general upward trend in price and some support and resistance levels can be identified, a more detailed analysis would be needed to make a buy or sell recommendation.</td>
</tr>

<tr>
  <td>HD</td>
  <td>Sell</td>
  <td>The stock price has been in a downtrend, creating a series of lower highs and lower lows. This is a bearish signal. Additionally, the most recent candle (2024-03-28) has a lower high and a lower close than the previous candle, which is a key reversal pattern. The volume on this most recent candle is also lower than the previous candle, which suggests a lack of buying interest. Therefore, I would recommend selling this stock.</td>
</tr>

<tr>
  <td>JNJ</td>
  <td>Neutral</td>
  <td>Based on the provided data, there are no clear patterns or indicators suggesting a buy or sell opportunity at the moment. There is no head and shoulders, inverse head and shoulder, key reversals, double bottom, double top, Adam and Eve double top, or Adam and Eve double bottom visible.

</tr>

<tr>
  <td>LIN</td>
  <td>Neutral</td>
  <td>The data provided covers a significant time period, and making a buy or sell decision based solely on this data would not be prudent. However, there are a few potential patterns that could be noted for future reference. For instance, there seems to be a support level around 320 and resistance around 330 in the earlier part of the data. Later, the price appears to have found support around 460. It is important to note that these observations are based solely on price action and do not take into account any fundamental analysis or other indicators.</td>
</tr>

  <td>LLY</td>
<td>Buy</td>
<td>Based on the price action and volume, the stock has been in an uptrend since 2022-03-29 with consistently higher highs and higher lows.

This pattern was accompanied by an increase in volume, adding to its significance.

  <td>Buy</td>
  <td>Based on the price action and volume, the stock has been in an uptrend since 2022-03-29 with consistently higher highs and higher lows. There are also higher volume spikes on the up days, indicating strong buying interest. Although there was a pullback on 2024-03-25, the stock quickly recovered and made a new high, which is a bullish sign. Additionally, there is a potential inverse head and shoulders pattern forming, which is a bullish reversal pattern. The buy verdict is reinforced by the double bottom pattern on 2022-03-31 and 2022-04-04, which is also a bullish pattern. Therefore, it is recommended to buy the stock.</td>
