  <td>ABBV</td>
  <td>Buy</td>
  <td>The stock price has been in an uptrend since 2022-03-29, with a series of higher highs and higher lows. On 2024-03-28, the stock formed a key reversal day, with a higher high and a close above the previous day's high, indicating strong buying pressure. Additionally, the stock has broken above a resistance level around 180, which had previously acted as a barrier to further price increases. These factors suggest that the stock is likely to continue its uptrend, making it a good buy candidate.</td>

<tr>
  <td>ACN</td>
  <td>Neutral</td>
  <td>The data provided does not contain clear patterns such as head and shoulders, inverse head and shoulders, double bottom, double top, Adam and Eve double top, Adam and Eve double bottom, or key reversals. Additionally, without a specific price point to analyze, it is difficult to provide a verdict based solely on support and resistance levels. Volume levels also do not show any significant spikes or drops that would indicate a change in trend. Therefore, a neutral verdict is appropriate.</td>
</tr>

<tr>
  <td>ADBE</td>
  <td>Buy</td>
  <td>Based on the price action and volume, the stock has been in an uptrend since 2022-04-01, with higher highs and higher lows. On 2024-03-25, there was a bullish engulfing pattern, where the body of the candle completely covered the previous candle's body, indicating a potential trend reversal or continuation. Additionally, the volume on that day was higher than the previous day, which could indicate buying pressure. Therefore, a buy verdict is recommended.</td>

  <td>AMD</td>
  <td>Neutral</td>
  <td>The provided data only includes price and volume, but does not include any clear patterns such as head and shoulders, key reversals, double bottom, double top, Adam and Eve double top, or Adam and Eve double bottom. Additionally, we cannot determine support and resistance levels without additional data. Therefore, based solely on the provided data, a neutral verdict is given.</td>

</tr>

<tr>
  <td>ASML</td>
  <td>Sell</td>
  <td>The stock has been in a downtrend since 2022-03-29, with lower highs and lower lows. There have been several key reversals, double tops, and bearish volume patterns that suggest further downside. Currently, the stock is near the top of its recent range, which could provide a good opportunity to sell or short the stock.</td>

<tr>
  <td>AVGO</td>
  <td>Neutral</td>
  <td>The data provided does not contain clear patterns such as head and shoulders, inverse head and shoulders, key reversals, double bottom, double top, Adam and Eve double top, or Adam and Eve double bottom. Price action and volume do not provide clear buy or sell signals on their own. Support and resistance levels cannot be accurately determined without additional context.</td>
</tr>

<tr>
  <td>AZN</td>
  <td>Neutral</td>
  <td>The data provided covers a significant time period and does not show any clear patterns or indicators that would suggest a buy or sell position. There are no clear support or resistance levels, head and shoulders, key reversals, or volume spikes that would suggest a trend. Therefore, a neutral position is recommended until further price action can provide more insight.</td>

  <td>BAC</td>
  <td>Neutral</td>
  <td>Based on the provided data, there are no clear patterns such as head and shoulders, inverse head and shoulders, double bottom, double top, Adam and Eve double top, Adam and Eve double bottom, or key reversals. The price has been generally decreasing, but there is no clear support or resistance level. Volume has not been particularly high during recent price changes, so it does not provide a clear signal. Therefore, a neutral stance is recommended.</td>
</tr>

<tr>
  <td>CCZ</td>
  <td>Neutral</td>
  <td>Based on the provided data, there are no clear patterns or indicators for buying or selling. There are no significant changes in price, support and resistance levels, volume, or any of the other technical analysis patterns mentioned. The price has been relatively stable with low volume, indicating a lack of interest or movement in the stock. Therefore, a neutral position is recommended until there are more clear indicators of a trend.</td>
</tr>

<tr>
  <td>COST</td>
  <td>Buy</td>
  <td>Based on the price action and volume, the stock has been in an uptrend since 2022-03-29 with consistently higher highs and higher lows. There have been several key reversals with higher volume, indicating strong buying interest. Additionally, the stock has formed a double bottom pattern on 2024-03-25 and 2024-03-26, which has been a bullish signal in the past. The stock has broken above the neckline of this pattern, which is another bullish sign. Therefore, I recommend a buy with a target price of 740 and a stop loss at 730.</td>
</tr>

<tr>
  <td>CRM</td>
  <td>Sell</td>
  <td>The stock price has been in a downtrend since 2024-03-25, with lower highs and lower lows. Additionally, the most recent candlestick on 2024-03-28 is a bearish engulfing pattern, which occurs when a small white candlestick is followed by a large black candlestick that completely covers the body of the small white candlestick. This pattern is often seen as a bearish signal, indicating that the bears have taken control of the market. Furthermore, volume has been increasing as the price has been decreasing, which is another bearish sign. Therefore, I would recommend selling this stock.</td>
</tr>

<tr>
  <td>CSCO</td>
  <td>Neutral</td>
  <td>Based on the provided data, there are no clear patterns such as head and shoulders, inverse head and shoulders, double tops, double bottoms, or key reversals. Price action has been generally decreasing, but there is no clear support or resistance level. Volume has not shown any significant increase or decrease. Therefore, a neutral position is recommended until clearer patterns emerge.</td>

  <td>Neutral</td>
  <td>The provided data does not contain any clear patterns such as head and shoulders, inverse head and shoulder, key reversals, double bottom, double top, Adam and Eve double top, or Adam and Eve double bottom. Additionally, there is no significant change in support and resistance levels or volume to justify a buy or sell verdict.</td>
</tr>

<tr>
  <td>DIS</td>
  <td>Sell</td>
  <td>The price has been in a downtrend since 2022-04-04, with lower highs and lower lows. Additionally, the most recent candlestick is a bearish engulfing pattern, which indicates a potential reversal in trend and is often a bearish signal. Furthermore, volume has been increasing as the price has been decreasing, which is another bearish signal. Therefore, I would recommend selling.</td>
</tr>

<tr>
  <td>FMX</td>
  <td>Buy</td>
  <td>Based on the price action and volume, the price has been in an uptrend since 2022-04-01, with higher highs and higher lows. Additionally, the volume has been increasing on up days, which is a bullish sign. There are no clear bearish patterns such as head and shoulders or double tops. Therefore, the verdict is to buy.</td>

  <td>GOOG</td>
  <td>Neutral</td>
  <td>Based on the provided data, there are no clear patterns such as head and shoulders, inverse head and shoulders, key reversals, double bottom, double top, Adam and Eve double top, or Adam and Eve double bottom. While there is a general downward trend in support and resistance levels from 2022-03-29 to 2022-04-01, the trend reverses and becomes generally upward from 2022-04-04 to 2024-03-28. However, there are no clear price action or volume patterns that suggest a strong buy or sell signal. Therefore, a neutral verdict is given.</td>
</tr>

<tr>
  <td>GOOGL</td>
  <td>Neutral</td>
  <td>The provided data only includes price and volume, making it difficult to identify specific patterns such as head and shoulders, key reversals, double bottom, double top, Adam and Eve double top, and Adam and Eve double bottom. While there is a general upward trend in price and some support and resistance levels can be identified, a more detailed analysis would be needed to make a buy or sell recommendation.</td>
</tr>

<tr>
  <td>HD</td>
  <td>Neutral</td>
  <td>The provided data only goes through 2024-03-28, so it's difficult to make a verdict based on price action, support and resistance, and other technical patterns without more data.</td>
</tr>

<tr>
  <td>JNJ</td>
  <td>Neutral</td>
  <td>Based on the provided data, there are no clear patterns or indicators suggesting a buy or sell opportunity at the moment. There is no head and shoulders, inverse head and shoulder, key reversals, double bottom, double top, Adam and Eve double top, or Adam and Eve double bottom visible. Price action and volume do not provide clear evidence for a trade either. Support and resistance levels cannot be accurately determined without more data.</td>
</tr>

<tr>
  <td>JPM</td>
  <td>Neutral</td>
  <td>Based on the provided data, I do not see any clear patterns or signals for buying or selling. There are no visible head and shoulders, inverse head and shoulders, key reversals, double bottoms, double tops, Adam and Eve double tops, or Adam and Eve double bottoms. Additionally, there is no obvious increase or decrease in volume that would suggest a change in market sentiment. Therefore, a neutral position is recommended.</td>
</tr>

  <td>KO</td>
  <td>Neutral</td>
  <td>Based on the provided historical price data, there are no clear patterns such as head and shoulders, inverse head and shoulders, key reversals, double bottom, double top, Adam and Eve double top, Adam and Eve double bottom, or significant volume changes that would typically inform a buy or sell decision. The price has been generally range-bound between 60 and 63 over the past few months. Therefore, a neutral stance is recommended.</td>
</tr>

<tr>
  <td>LIN</td>
  <td>Neutral</td>
  <td>The data provided covers a significant time period, and making a buy or sell decision based solely on this data would not be prudent. However, there are a few potential patterns that could be noted for future reference. For instance, there seems to be a support level around 320 and resistance around 330 in the earlier part of the data. Later, the price appears to have found support around 460. It is important to note that these observations are based solely on price action and do not take into account any fundamental analysis or other indicators.</td>
</tr>

<tr>
  <td>LLY</td>
  <td>Neutral</td>
  <td>The data provided covers a significant time period, and making a verdict based solely on price action, support and resistance, and volume would require a more detailed analysis of the trends and patterns within this time frame. A neutral verdict is given due to the limited context of the provided data.</td>
</tr>

<tr>
  <td>MA</td>
  <td>Buy</td>
  <td>Based on the price action and volume, the stock has been in an uptrend since 2022-03-29 with higher highs and higher lows. Although there was a slight pullback on 2022-03-31, the stock quickly recovered and closed higher in the following days. The volume has been decreasing during this pullback, which could indicate a lack of sellers and a potential for the uptrend to continue. There are no clear bearish patterns such as head and shoulders, double top, or key reversals. Therefore, a buy verdict is recommended.</td>
</tr>

<tr>
  <td>MCD</td>
  <td>Buy</td>
  <td>Based on the price action and volume, the stock has been in an uptrend since 2022-03-29 with consistently higher highs and higher lows. On 2024-03-27, there was a bullish key reversal pattern with a higher low and a close above the previous day's high, indicating a potential continuation of the uptrend. Additionally, volume has been increasing on bullish days, which is a positive sign. Therefore, I would recommend a 'buy' verdict.</td>
</tr>

<tr>
  <td>META</td>
  <td>Sell</td>
  <td>The stock price has been forming a double top pattern with the two recent highs of approximately 234 and 229. This pattern suggests a potential reversal in the trend and a possible downward movement. Additionally, volume has been decreasing as the price approached the second high, which can also be a bearish signal. However, it's important to note that these patterns are not always 100% accurate and should be used in conjunction with other forms of analysis.</td>
</tr>

<tr>
  <td>MRK</td>
  <td>Buy</td>
  <td>Based on the price action and volume, the stock has been in an uptrend since 2022-03-29 with consistently higher highs and higher lows. There are also higher volume spikes on the up days, indicating strong buying interest. Although there was a pullback on 2024-03-22, the stock found support at the previous resistance-turned-support level around 124.08, forming a double bottom pattern. This, along with the bullish price action and volume, suggests a continuation of the uptrend. Therefore, I recommend a "buy" verdict.</td>
</tr>

  <td>MSFT</td>
  <td>Neutral</td>
  <td>Based on the given data, there are no clear patterns such as head and shoulders, inverse head and shoulders, key reversals, double bottom, double top, Adam and Eve double top, or Adam and Eve double bottom. While there is some price action and support/resistance near the 420-425 range, the volume does not suggest any significant change in trend. Therefore, a neutral verdict is given.</td>
</tr>

<tr>
  <td>NFLX</td>
  <td>Neutral</td>
  <td>Based on the provided data, there are no clear patterns or indicators for buying or selling. There is no evidence of head and shoulders, inverse head and shoulders, key reversals, double bottom, double top, Adam and Eve double top, or Adam and Eve double bottom. Price action has been relatively steady, with some ups and downs, but no clear trends. Support and resistance levels are not explicitly provided, and volume has not shown any significant spikes or drops. Therefore, a neutral verdict is given.</td>

<tr>
  <td>NVDA</td>
  <td>Sell</td>
  <td>The stock price has been in a downtrend since 2022-03-29, with lower highs and lower lows. On 2024-03-28, there was a key reversal day with a higher high followed by a lower close, which is a bearish sign. Additionally, volume has been increasing on down days, which confirms the selling pressure. Therefore, I recommend selling this stock.</td>
</tr>

<tr>
  <td>NVO</td>
  <td>Buy</td>
  <td>The stock price has been in an uptrend since 2022-03-29, with a series of higher highs and higher lows. On 2024-03-28, there was a key reversal day with a higher high followed by a lower close, which could indicate a potential short-term top. However, the overall trend remains bullish, and the price is still above the support level of 55.099998 (the low on 2022-03-30). Therefore, a buy verdict is given, with a stop loss at 128.050003 (the low on 2024-03-27) to limit potential losses if the trend reverses.</td>

There are no head and shoulders, inverse head and shoulders, double bottoms, double tops, Adam and Eve double tops, or Adam and Eve double bottoms present. Additionally, there are no key reversals or significant volume increases on any of the days. While there has been a general upward trend in price, there have also been several recent decreases in price, making it difficult to determine a clear trend. Therefore, a neutral position is recommended.</td>

  <td>PEP</td>
  <td>Neutral</td>
  <td>Based on the provided data, there are no clear patterns or indicators suggesting to buy or sell. There are no head and shoulders, inverse head and shoulders, double tops, double bottoms, or key reversals present. While there is some resistance around 175 and support around 172, the price has not yet shown a clear pattern of testing and respecting these levels. Volume has not spiked significantly in relation to price movements. Therefore, a neutral stance is recommended until clearer patterns emerge.</td>

  <td>The given data shows the daily price action of a stock from 2022-03-29 to 2024-03-28.

  <td>Based on the price action and technical analysis, the stock has been in an uptrend since 2022-03-29 with higher highs and higher lows. On 2024-03-25, there was a bullish engulfing pattern (key reversal), where the body of the candle completely covered the previous candle, indicating a potential trend reversal or a strong buying pressure. Additionally, the stock has broken above the resistance level of 67.00, which can be seen as a bullish sign. Therefore, a buy verdict is recommended.</td>

  <td>The stock price has been forming a descending trend with lower highs and lower lows, indicating a bearish outlook. Additionally, the most recent candle (2024-03-28) has a lower high and a lower low than the previous candle, which is a key reversal pattern. This suggests that the bears are in control and it may be a good time to sell.</td>

  <td>The stock price has been in an uptrend since 2022-03-29, with a series of higher highs and higher lows. On 2024-03-22, a key reversal day occurred, where the stock made a new high but closed near its low, indicating selling pressure. However, the stock found support at the previous resistance level of 60.36 (from 2024-03-25 to 2024-03-27) and closed above it on 2024-03-28. This is a bullish sign, as it shows that the previous resistance level has now turned into support. Additionally, the volume on the key reversal day (2024-03-22) was significantly higher than the previous days, indicating a potential change in trend. Therefore, I recommend buying the stock.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
  <td>XOM</td>
  <td>Neutral</td>
  <td>Based on the provided data, I do not see clear patterns that would suggest a 'buy' or 'sell' verdict. I'll briefly discuss the data and potential patterns that could emerge in the future.

1. Support and Resistance: The price has been fluctuating within the range of approximately 76 to 81 in the early part of the dataset and has expanded to around 113 to 116 in the later part. These levels could act as support and resistance, but more data is needed to confirm.
2. Head and Shoulders: I do not see a clear head and shoulders pattern in the data. A head and shoulders pattern would typically have a clear 'head' and two 'shoulders' with a support level (neckline), which is not evident in the dataset.
3. Double Tops and Bottoms: There are no clear double tops or bottoms in the dataset. These patterns usually have a more defined 'M' or 'W' shape, which is not present here.
4. Key Reversals: Key reversals are difficult to identify with the given data, as they typically require a higher time frame or more granular price data.
5. Volume: Volume seems to be decreasing overall, which could indicate a lack of interest or consolidation before a potential breakout. However, volume is not significantly high during the price swings, which would be expected in a more decisive pattern.

Due to the lack of clear patterns and the limited information provided, I will maintain a 'neutral' verdict. Continue monitoring the price action and support/resistance levels for potential future opportunities.</td>
