<td>AAPL</td>
<td>Neutral</td>
<td>Based on the provided data, there are no clear buy or sell signals from the technical indicators we are considering. There is no evidence of head and shoulders, inverse head and shoulders, key reversals, double bottom, double top, Adam and Eve double top, or Adam and Eve double bottom patterns. While there has been some price movement, it has not been significant or consistent enough to suggest a clear trend. Additionally, volume data does not show any unusual spikes that might suggest an impending price move. Therefore, our recommendation is to hold the current position for now.</td>

<tr>
  <td>ABBV</td>
  <td>Sell</td>
  <td>The stock has formed a double top pattern at the end of the provided data, indicating a potential reversal in trend. This pattern is confirmed by the decline in volume as the price approached the second top. Additionally, the price has fallen below the "neckline" of the pattern (calculated as the lowest point between the two tops, around 165). This confirms the bearish signal. Therefore, a sell recommendation is made.</td>
</tr>


<tr>
  <td>ACN</td>
  <td>Neutral</td>
  <td>The price has been in a downtrend since April 11, 2022, with a series of lower highs and lower lows. However, there are no clear reversal patterns such as key reversals, double bottom, or inverse head and shoulders visible in the data. The volume has not shown any significant increase during the recent price movements. Therefore, it is best to adopt a neutral stance until a clearer trend emerges.</td>
</tr>


<tr>
  <td>ADBE</td>
  <td>Neutral</td>
  <td>The price has been in an uptrend since 2022-04-14, but there are no clear bullish patterns such as a double bottom or key reversals. There is also no clear resistance level. However, the price has been testing the support level around 420 in the last few days. With the RSI around 50, it is currently in a neutral zone. Therefore, it is best to wait for a clearer signal before making a decision.</td>
</tr>

<tr>
  <td>AMD</td>
  <td>Sell</td>
  <td>The stock price has been in a downtrend since 2024-04-05, with lower highs and lower lows. On 2024-04-10, there was a key reversal day, where the stock made a new low and then closed above the previous day's high. This is a bearish sign. Additionally, volume has been increasing on the down days, which is another bearish signal. The stock is currently near the resistance level of 170, which it has failed to break through. Therefore, the analysis suggests selling the stock.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
  <td>AMZN</td>
  <td>Buy</td>
  <td>Based on the price data provided, we can identify a potential inverse head and shoulders pattern, which is typically a bullish signal. The "head" of the pattern occurred on April 14, 2022, with a low of 151.706497. The "shoulders" occurred on April 11, 2022, with a high of 154.136505, and April 18, 2022, with a high of 154.039505. The "neckline" of the pattern can be drawn along the lows of the "shoulders," which comes in around 153. Additionally, volume increased on the breakout above the neckline on April 13, 2022, adding credence to the pattern. Therefore, based on this analysis, a "buy" recommendation is warranted.</td>
</tr>
<tr><td>ASML</td><td>Buy</td><td>Based on the price data provided, we can identify a potential inverse head and shoulders pattern, which is typically a bullish signal. The "head" of the pattern occurred on April 18, 2024, with a low of 597.05, followed by a "shoulder" on the left at a higher price level. The "right shoulder" is currently being formed and is still in the process of being validated. A breakout above the "neckline" resistance level, which is around 990, would confirm the pattern and provide a strong buy signal. Currently, the stock is trading at 974.61, which is still below the neckline, but the recent price action suggests that a breakout could occur soon. Therefore, I would recommend a buy verdict with a tight stop loss above the recent high of 996.79.</td></tr>

<tr>
    <td>AVGO</td>
    <td>Buy</td>
    <td>The stock price has been in an overall uptrend, with several key reversals and a double bottom pattern around rows 300-320, indicating a potential trend reversal and continuation. The price has broken above the neckline of this pattern, confirming the buy signal. Additionally, volume has been increasing during the recent rallies, adding credence to the bullish outlook.</td>
</tr>


<tr>
    <td>AZN</td>
    <td>Neutral</td>
    <td>The stock price has been in a downtrend since 2022-04-11, but there are no clear reversal patterns or significant volume increases to suggest a trend change. The price has tested the support level around 68.5 several times, and it has held so far. However, without a clear reversal signal, it's best to remain neutral for now.</td>
</tr>

<tr>
  <td>BAC</td>
  <td>Neutral</td>
  <td>The price has been in a downtrend since April 12, 2022, with a few rallies in between. There are no clear bullish patterns such as head and shoulders or double bottoms. The price has found some support around the 36.5-37 level, but it has not shown any signs of a strong reversal yet. The volume has been decreasing, which is a sign of a lack of buying pressure. Therefore, it is best to wait for a clearer signal before making a decision.</td>
</tr>

<tr>
  <td>CCZ</td>
  <td>Neutral</td>
  <td>Based on the provided data, there are no clear trading signals from the technical indicators we are considering. The stock price has been flat for an extended period with no significant price action, support or resistance levels, key reversals, or volume increases. Therefore, a neutral position is recommended until there are more clear indications of a trend.</td>
</tr>


<tr>
    <td>COST</td>
    <td>Buy</td>
    <td>The stock has been in an uptrend, with higher highs and higher lows. Although there was a pullback from 4/13 to 4/18, the stock found support near the previous resistance level of ~585 and bounced back. The recent breakout above the 700 level on high volume on 4/10 is a bullish sign. Additionally, the stock has formed a "cup and handle" pattern, which is typically a bullish continuation pattern. Therefore, a buy verdict is recommended.</td>
</tr>


<tr>
  <td>CRM</td>
  <td>Buy</td>
  <td>The stock has been in an uptrend from 2022-04-14 to 2024-04-10, with several bullish patterns identified. These include a key reversal on 2022-04-13, where the stock made a new low but closed higher, and a double bottom pattern on 2022-04-14 and 2022-04-18, where the stock found support at the same level twice before rebounding. Additionally, the stock broke above a resistance level at around 196.00 on 2022-04-13 and has been making higher highs and higher lows since then. The volume has also been increasing on the recent up days, indicating strong buying interest. Therefore, I recommend a "buy" verdict for this stock.</td>
</tr>

<tr>
    <td>CSCO</td>
    <td>Sell</td>
    <td>The stock has been in a downtrend since April 11, 2022, with lower highs and lower lows. On April 9, 2024, the stock formed a double top pattern with a resistance level around 50.20. The stock closed below this level on April 10, 2024, confirming the bearish signal. Additionally, volume has been increasing on down days, which is a sign of selling pressure. Therefore, I recommend selling the stock.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
  <td>CVX</td>
  <td>Buy</td>
  <td>Based on the price data provided, we can identify a potential inverse head and shoulders pattern, which is typically a bullish signal. The "head" formed around April 14, 2022, with a low of ~159.297, and was followed by two "shoulders" around April 11, 2022 (~153.699) and April 18, 2022 (~161.432). The neckline of this pattern can be drawn around ~160.6. As the price closed above the neckline on April 10, 2024 (~162.669), it suggests a potential buy opportunity. Additionally, volume during the formation of the right shoulder (April 18, 2022) was lower than during the left shoulder, which is another bullish signal in this pattern.</td>
</tr>

<tr>
  <td>FMX</td>
  <td>Neutral</td>
  <td>The stock price has been in an overall uptrend from 2022-04-11 to 2024-04-10, with several support levels along the way. However, the most recent price action shows a potential double top pattern, with the highs on 2024-04-04 and 2024-04-05, and a lower high on 2024-04-09. This could indicate a potential reversal or consolidation in the near term. Additionally, volume has been decreasing since the high on 2024-04-04, which could also suggest a potential reversal. However, there is still support at the 125.739998 level, and the stock has not yet closed below this level. Therefore, a neutral stance is recommended until further price action confirms a reversal or continuation of the uptrend.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>GOOG</td>
<td>Sell</td>
<td>The stock price has been in an overall downtrend since 2022-04-11, with a series of lower highs and lower lows. On 2024-04-09, a bearish inverse head and shoulders pattern appeared, which was confirmed on the following day with a break below the neckline. The volume on 2024-04-09 was also significantly higher than average, indicating strong selling pressure. Considering these factors, it is advisable to sell this stock.</td>
</tr>

<tr>
  <td>HD</td>
  <td>Neutral</td>
  <td>The price has been in an overall uptrend since 2022-04-11, but there are no clear bullish patterns such as key reversals, double bottom, or inverse head and shoulders in the recent data. There is also no clear resistance level to indicate a sell opportunity. Therefore, a neutral position is recommended until there are more clear signals.</td>
</tr>


<tr>
  <td>JNJ</td>
  <td>Neutral</td>
  <td>The stock price has been in a downtrend since April 11, 2022, with a series of lower highs and lower lows. However, there are no clear technical patterns or indicators suggesting a buy or sell opportunity at the moment. The stock has found some support around the $150 level, but it has not shown any signs of a strong reversal. The volume has been relatively low and inconsistent, which suggests a lack of conviction from buyers or sellers. Therefore, a neutral stance is recommended until a clearer trend or pattern emerges.</td>
</tr>

<tr>
  <td>JPM</td>
  <td>Sell</td>
  <td>The stock price has been in a downtrend since 2022-04-11, with a series of lower highs and lower lows. On 2024-04-10, the price formed a double top pattern with the two previous highs, which is a bearish signal. Additionally, volume has been increasing on down days, which is another bearish signal. Therefore, I would recommend selling this stock.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>KO</td>
<td>Neutral</td>
<td>The stock price has been relatively stable over the past few days, with no clear trend or significant patterns emerging. There have been no key reversals, head and shoulders, or other major chart patterns that would suggest a strong buy or sell signal. While the stock did close slightly down on the most recent day, this alone is not enough to justify a strong recommendation. Therefore, a neutral stance is advised until more clear trends or patterns emerge.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
  <td>LIN</td>
  <td>Neutral</td>
  <td>The price has been generally increasing since 2022-04-11, with no clear bearish patterns such as head and shoulders, double top, or key reversals. However, there was a slight dip on 2024-04-10, which could be a potential buying opportunity if it breaks the support level at 450.489990 with increased volume. It's important to monitor the price action and volume for any potential bearish or bullish signals.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
    <td>LLY</td>
    <td>Neutral</td>
    <td>Based on the provided data, there are no clear buy or sell signals from the technical indicators we are considering. There is no evidence of key reversals, double bottoms, double tops, head and shoulders, or inverse head and shoulders patterns. Price has been generally decreasing, but there has not been a significant enough decrease to indicate a strong sell signal. Additionally, volume has not spiked in a way that would confirm a trend change. Therefore, our analysis suggests a neutral position at this time.</td>
</tr>

<tr>
    <td>META</td>
    <td>Sell</td>
    <td>The stock price has been in a downtrend since 2024-04-05, with lower highs and lower lows. On 2024-04-10, there was a key reversal day, where the stock made a new high for the move but closed near the low of the day, which is a bearish sign. Additionally, volume has been increasing on down days, which is another bearish signal. The stock has also formed a double top pattern, with the two peaks at 530.000000 and 530.700012, and both peaks have failed to break through the resistance level. The neckline of the double top pattern is at around 516.00, which was broken on 2024-04-10. Therefore, the pattern is complete and the target price for the downside move is 500.00, which is the height of the pattern added to the neckline. Therefore, I recommend selling the stock.</td>

  <td>The stock price has been in a downtrend since 2024-04-05, with lower highs and lower lows. There is also a double top pattern formed between 2024-04-04 and 2024-04-05, which is a bearish signal. Additionally, volume has been decreasing as the price has been decreasing, which is often a sign of selling pressure. Therefore, I would recommend selling this stock.</td>

  <td>NFLX</td>
  <td>Buy</td>
  <td>The stock has been in an uptrend from 2022-04-11 to 2024-04-10, with several key reversals and higher highs and higher lows. The stock also formed a double bottom pattern on 2022-04-18 and 2022-04-19, which is a bullish signal. Additionally, the volume has been increasing on the recent rallies, indicating strong buying interest. Therefore, I recommend a "buy" on this stock.</td>

On 2024-04-10, there was a key reversal day, where the stock made a new high for the move but closed near the low of the day, indicating selling pressure. Additionally, volume has been increasing on the down days, which is a bearish sign. The stock is currently near the resistance level of the downward trendline, making it a good level to sell or short the stock.</td>

    <td>Buy</td>
    <td>The stock has been in an uptrend from 2022-04-11 to 2024-04-10, with several key reversals and higher highs and higher lows. On 2024-04-09, the stock formed a double top pattern with a higher volume, which is a bullish signal. Although the stock price dropped slightly on 2024-04-10, the volume was lower, indicating a lack of selling pressure. Therefore, I would recommend buying the stock with a stop loss at 123.239998 (the low of 2024-04-10) and a target price of 130 (based on the trend analysis and the double top pattern).</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>ORCL</td>
<td>Neutral</td>
<td>Based on the provided data, there are no clear buy or sell signals from the technical indicators we are considering. Price action over the past few days has been relatively sideways, with the stock closing near the middle of its daily range. There are no clear key reversals, double tops or bottoms, or head and shoulders patterns. Support and resistance levels are not clearly defined in this range, and volume has not been particularly high or low. Therefore, it is difficult to make a definitive recommendation based on this data alone. It may be worth waiting for further price action or additional technical signals before making a trading decision.</td>

<td>Based on the provided data, there are no clear buy or sell signals from the technical indicators we are considering. There is no evidence of key reversals, double bottoms, double tops, head and shoulders, or inverse head and shoulders patterns. Price has been generally decreasing, but there has not been a significant enough decrease to indicate a strong sell signal. Additionally, there is no clear support or resistance level that has been broken. Volume has not shown any significant spikes or drops that would indicate a change in market sentiment. Therefore, our analysis is neutral at this time.</td>

  <td>Neutral</td>
  <td>Based on the provided data, there are no clear buy or sell signals from the technical indicators we are considering. There is no evidence of key reversals, head and shoulders, or inverse head and shoulders patterns. The price has been in a relatively narrow range, with support around 155-156 and resistance around 159-160, but this is not a strong trend. Volume has not been particularly high or low, and there is no clear pattern to suggest a change in trend. Therefore, our analysis is neutral at this time.</td>

<tr>
    <td>SHEL</td>
    <td>Buy</td>
    <td>The stock price has been in an uptrend since 2022-04-11, with higher highs and higher lows. There have been several bullish signals during this period, including a key reversal on 2022-04-13, where the stock made a lower low followed by a higher high. Additionally, there was a double bottom pattern on 2022-04-11 and 2022-04-12, which was confirmed when the stock broke above the neckline at 56.73. The volume has also been increasing during this uptrend, which is a positive sign. Since the stock is still in the uptrend and there have been no bearish signals, the verdict is to buy.</td>
</tr>

<tr>
  <td>TM</td>
  <td>Neutral</td>
  <td>The price has been in an uptrend since 2022-04-14, but there are no clear bearish reversal patterns or strong resistance levels in the recent price action.

Therefore, a neutral stance is recommended until there are clearer signals.</td>

However, the most recent candle on 2024-04-10 shows a slight increase in price and volume, which could indicate a potential reversal. However, it is not yet confirmed as a key reversal pattern. Therefore, a neutral stance is advised until further price action is observed.</td>

    <td>TSLA</td>
    <td>Buy</td>
    <td>The stock price has been in a general downtrend, but there are signs of a potential reversal. On 2024-04-09, there was a key reversal day, where the stock made a new low but closed above the previous day's high. This is a bullish sign. Additionally, the stock has formed what appears to be a double bottom pattern, with the lows on 2024-04-05 and 2024-04-08, and the neckline at around 173. If the stock breaks above this neckline, it could be a strong buy signal. The volume on the most recent day (2024-04-10) was lower than the previous day, which is not ideal, but not necessarily a negative sign. Overall, I would recommend a buy at the current price, with a stop loss set just below the recent low of 171.11.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
  <td>TSM</td>
  <td>Buy</td>
  <td>Based on the price data provided, we can identify a potential inverse head and shoulders pattern, which is typically a bullish signal. The "head" of the pattern occurred on 2024-04-05 with a low of 140.00, and was preceded by a left shoulder on 2024-04-04 with a high of 144.00. The right shoulder formed on 2024-04-08 with a high of 146.00. The "neckline" of the pattern can be drawn connecting the lows of the left shoulder and the right shoulder, which occurs at around 142.75. Today's price action closed above the neckline, confirming the bullish signal. Additionally, volume increased on the breakout day, which is another bullish signal. Therefore, our verdict is to buy.</td>

However, there are no clear patterns or indicators that suggest a strong "buy" or "sell" signal at this time. There is a potential double top pattern around the 217 level, but it is not yet confirmed. Additionally, there is a potential inverse head and shoulders pattern around the 210 level, but again, it is not yet confirmed. Volume has been relatively high and consistent, which is a positive sign, but more data is needed before making a definitive recommendation.</td>

There is a potential inverse head and shoulders pattern, but the recent price action and volume do not confirm a bullish reversal. The stock closed below its support level at 56.939999 on April 10, 2024, indicating a potential continuation of the downtrend. Therefore, a sell recommendation is appropriate.</td>

On April 10, 2024, the stock made a new high above the previous high on April 13, 2022. This is a bullish price action. There is no evidence of head and shoulders, inverse head and shoulders, double top, double bottom, Adam and Eve double top, or Adam and Eve double bottom patterns in the data. Volume has been trending upwards since April 11, 2022, which is a positive sign. Based on this analysis, I would recommend a "buy" verdict.</td></tr>

There is a potential inverse head and shoulders pattern that has formed, with the "head" at around April 18, 2023 at a price of ~88.50 and the "shoulders" at around April 11, 2022 at a price of ~85.78 and April 8, 2024 at a price of ~121.08. The "neckline" of this pattern is around the ~119.72 price level (the low between the two shoulders). A break above this neckline would be a bullish signal and could indicate further upside. Additionally, volume has been increasing on the recent price advances, which is another bullish signal. Therefore, I would recommend a "buy" on this stock.</td>

There is no evidence of head and shoulders, inverse head and shoulders, key reversals, double bottom, double top, Adam and Eve double top, or Adam and Eve double bottom patterns.

It is best to wait for further price action before making a decision.</td>

<td>MSFT</td>
<td>Buy</td>
<td>The stock price has been in an uptrend, with higher highs and higher lows. Although the price dropped slightly in the last few days, it found support around 420, which is a strong level as it has acted as both support and resistance in the past. Additionally, the volume on the recent drop was lower than the volume on the preceding rallies, which could indicate a lack of sellers. This, combined with the overall uptrend, suggests that the stock could be a buy.</td>

<td>The stock has been in a downtrend since 4/09, with lower highs and lower lows. Additionally, the most recent candle (4/10) closed below the support level of 187.89, indicating a potential continuation of the downtrend. The volume on 4/10 was also lower than the previous day, which is often a sign of decreasing interest in the stock. It is recommended to sell the stock at the current price.</td>
