  <td>AAPL</td>
  <td>Buy</td>
  <td>The stock price has broken out above the recent resistance level of 171, indicating a potential uptrend. Additionally, the price has formed an "inverse head and shoulders" pattern, which is typically bullish. The high volume on the most recent day also supports this bullish outlook. Therefore, I would recommend a "buy" verdict.</td>

  <td>ABBV</td>
  <td>Neutral</td>
  <td>Based on the provided data, there are no clear buy or sell signals from the indicators we are considering. There is no head and shoulders, inverse head and shoulders, key reversals, double bottom, double top, Adam and Eve double top, or Adam and Eve double bottom patterns present. Price action has been relatively sideways, and there hasn't been a significant break of support or resistance levels. Volume has also been relatively low and inconsistent, providing no clear signal. Therefore, our analysis is neutral at this time.</td>

  <td>ACN</td>
  <td>Neutral</td>
  <td>The price has been in a general uptrend since 2022-04-14, but there are no clear bullish patterns such as a double bottom or key reversals in the recent data. There is also no clear resistance level to indicate a potential sell-off. The volume has been relatively low and inconsistent, which suggests that there is no strong conviction among traders. Therefore, a neutral stance is advised until there are more clear signals.</td>

<tr>
  <td>ADBE</td>
  <td>Neutral</td>
  <td>Based on the provided data, I do not see any clear buy or sell signals using the mentioned indicators. There are no visible head and shoulders, inverse head and shoulders, key reversals, double bottoms, double tops, Adam and Eve double tops, or Adam and Eve double bottoms. Price action has been relatively range-bound, and volume has not shown any significant spikes. Support and resistance levels can be estimated to be around 480 and 490 respectively, but without a clear trend or pattern, it is difficult to make a definitive recommendation. It is best to wait for more price data and confirmatory patterns before making a trading decision.</td>

Price action has been generally trending upwards, but there was a slight dip on 2024-04-10 which has since recovered. Support and resistance levels are not explicitly provided, and volume has not shown any significant spikes or drops. Therefore, our analysis is neutral at this time.</td>

  <td>Buy</td>
  <td>The stock price has been in an uptrend, with higher highs and higher lows. There was a key reversal on 2024-04-10, where the stock made a lower low but closed higher, indicating buying pressure. The stock also broke above a resistance level around 186.74 (the high on 2024-04-10) on increased volume, which is a bullish sign. Additionally, the stock has formed an "Adam and Eve" double bottom pattern, which is typically a bullish pattern. Therefore, I recommend a "buy" verdict.</td>

<td>ASML</td>
<td>Buy</td>
<td>The stock price has been in an uptrend, with higher highs and higher lows. Today's price action shows a key reversal, with a higher low and a close above the previous day's high. This is a bullish sign. Additionally, the price has broken above a resistance level around 990, which had previously been a double top. This breakout is a strong indication of further upward movement. The volume has been increasing, which confirms the strength of the move. Therefore, I would recommend a "buy" verdict.</td>

    <td>AVGO</td>
    <td>Buy</td>
    <td>Based on the price data provided, we can observe a key reversal pattern on 2024-04-11, where the stock price formed a lower low followed by a higher high, indicating a potential trend reversal.

There is no head and shoulders, inverse head and shoulders, double bottom, double top, Adam and Eve double top, or Adam and Eve double bottom pattern visible. The price did break slightly above the previous resistance level of ~69.00, but the volume did not confirm this breakout.

</tr>
<tr>
    <td>BAC</td>
    <td>Neutral</td>
    <td>Based on the provided data, there are no clear buy or sell signals from the technical indicators we are considering.

Price action does not show any significant trends or patterns. There is some support around the 36.5-37 level, but it has been tested several times recently, which could indicate a potential weakness in this level.

There are no clear support and resistance levels, head and shoulders, inverse head and shoulders, key reversals, double bottoms, double tops, Adam and Eve double tops, or Adam and Eve double bottoms present in the data.

Volume has been relatively stable and does not show any significant changes that would suggest a shift in market sentiment.

Therefore, based on the available data, a neutral stance is recommended.</td>

On 11/04/2024, the stock made a new high at 733.789978, surpassing the previous high of 723.979980 set on 10/04/2024. This is a bullish sign and suggests that the uptrend is still intact. Additionally, the stock has consistently closed above its opening price for the past few days, indicating strong buying pressure. The volume has also been increasing, which is another bullish sign. Therefore, I would recommend a "buy" verdict for this stock.</td>

  <td>CRM</td>
  <td>Buy</td>
  <td>The stock has been in an uptrend since April 2022, with a few corrections along the way. The stock formed a "double bottom" pattern in April-May 2023, which is a bullish reversal pattern. The stock broke above the neckline of the pattern on April 10, 2024, indicating a potential continuation of the uptrend. The stock also formed a "key reversal" on April 11, 2024, which is a bullish signal. The volume has been increasing during the recent rallies, indicating strong buying interest. Therefore, I recommend a "buy" on the stock.</td>

    <td>Buy</td>
    <td>The stock price has been in an uptrend from 4/12/2022 to 4/11/2024, with several key reversals and higher highs and higher lows. On 4/9/2024, the stock formed a bullish inverse head and shoulders pattern, which was confirmed on 4/11/2024 when the price broke above the neckline resistance of 50.00. The volume on 4/9/2024 was also significantly higher than the previous days, indicating strong buying interest. Therefore, I recommend a "buy" on this stock.</td>

While there is a slight upward trend in the closing prices, it is not significant enough to make a definitive buy or sell recommendation. Additionally, there do not appear to be any clear support or resistance levels, head and shoulders, or other patterns that would indicate a strong trend. Therefore, our analysis is neutral at this time.</td>
</tr>

<tr>
    <td>DIS</td>

    <td>Based on the provided data, there are no clear buy or sell signals from the indicators we are considering. There is no evidence of head and shoulders, inverse head and shoulders, key reversals, double bottom, double top, Adam and Eve double top, or Adam and Eve double bottom patterns.

Support and resistance levels are not explicitly provided but can be estimated; the range of recent closing prices is around 116.6 to 118.4. Therefore, our analysis suggests a neutral stance for this time being.</td>

  <td>The stock has been in a downtrend since 4/10, with lower highs and lower lows. Additionally, the most recent candle (4/11) closed below the support level of 126.629997, indicating a potential continuation of the downtrend.

  <td>Neutral</td>
  <td>The price has been in a downtrend since 4/9, but there are no clear reversal patterns or strong support/resistance levels.

The "neckline" of the pattern can be drawn as a horizontal line connecting the lows of the shoulders, around 244.

There was a key reversal on 2024-04-08, where the stock made a new high but closed near the low of the day, indicating selling pressure. However, the stock was able to recover and close higher on 2024-04-09 and 2024-04-10, suggesting that the bulls are still in control. The volume on 2024-04-10 was also higher than the previous day, indicating strong buying interest. Therefore, I recommend a "buy" on this stock.</td>

The 'neckline' can be drawn connecting the highs of the troughs, around 216.990005 and 276.820007. Today's close at 275.679993 is a break above this neckline, indicating a potential buy signal. This is further supported by increasing volume on the upswing, which is another bullish signal. Therefore, my verdict is to buy.</td>

It is recommended to place a stop loss below the most recent support level around 121 to limit potential losses.</td>
