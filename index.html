<tr>
  <td>AAPL</td>
  <td>Buy</td>
  <td>The stock price has been in an uptrend since 2019, with several key reversals and higher highs and higher lows. The stock also broke out above a double top pattern in April 2024, which is a bullish signal. Additionally, volume has been increasing on up days, which is another positive sign. However, it is important to note that the stock is currently overbought and a pullback may occur in the short term. Therefore, a strategic entry point may be at a support level or after a pullback in price.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
    <td>ABBV</td>
    <td>Sell</td>
    <td>The stock price has been in a downtrend over the past few weeks, with lower highs and lower lows. Additionally, the stock has formed a double top pattern, which is typically a bearish signal. The volume has also increased during the recent price declines, which could indicate that larger institutional investors are selling the stock. Therefore, it may be advisable to sell the stock at its current price.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
  <td>ACN</td>
  <td>Sell</td>
  <td>The stock has been in a downtrend since the week of 2024-03-18, with lower highs and lower lows. Additionally, the stock formed a double top pattern in the weeks of 2024-03-11 and 2024-03-25, which is a bearish signal. The volume has also been increasing on down weeks, which is another bearish signal. The stock has broken below a key support level at around $345, which is a strong sell signal. Therefore, I would recommend selling this stock.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>ADBE</td>
<td>Sell</td>
<td>The stock price has been in a downtrend for the past few weeks, with lower highs and lower lows. Additionally, the most recent weekly candle is a bearish key reversal, where the price opened at its high but closed near its low, indicating strong selling pressure. The volume has also been increasing on down weeks, which is another bearish signal. There is also a potential inverse head and shoulders pattern, but the right shoulder has not yet formed, and the price would need to break above the neckline resistance for this pattern to be valid. Overall, the technical analysis suggests a sell verdict for this stock.</td>
</tr>

<tr>
  <td>AMD</td>
  <td>Sell</td>
  <td>The stock price has been in a downtrend for the past few weeks, with lower highs and lower lows. This is a bearish sign. Additionally, the stock has formed a double top pattern, which is also a bearish signal. The double top pattern is confirmed by the volume, which was higher on the breakout down. Therefore, I would recommend selling this stock.</td>
</tr>

<tr>
  <td>AMZN</td>
  <td>Sell</td>
  <td>The stock price has been in a downtrend for the past 3 weeks, with lower highs and lower lows. Additionally, the price has broken down below a key support level around 180. The volume has also increased on the down days, which is a bearish sign. Therefore, I would recommend selling this stock.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>ASML</td>
<td>Sell</td>
<td>The stock price has formed a double top pattern at around 1000, with two consecutive peaks at similar levels and a trough in between. This pattern indicates a potential reversal in trend from bullish to bearish. Additionally, volume has been decreasing as the price approached the second peak, which is another bearish signal. Therefore, it would be advisable to sell this stock.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
    <td>AVGO</td>
    <td>Sell</td>
    <td>The stock price has been in an uptrend for a long period of time, and there are signs of a potential reversal. Specifically, the past two weekly candles have been bearish engulfing patterns, which occur when a small white candle is followed by a large black candle that completely covers the body of the small white candle. This is often a sign of selling pressure. Additionally, the stock has reached a resistance level around 1400, which has been tested multiple times in the past few weeks. The high volume on the most recent candle also suggests that a significant number of investors are selling the stock. Therefore, I would recommend selling the stock at its current price.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
  <td>AZN</td>
  <td>Buy</td>
  <td>The stock price has been in an uptrend since 2019, with several key reversals and a clear break above resistance at ~$40. Although there was a recent pullback to ~$66, the price has since recovered and closed near the high of the week at ~$69. This indicates strong buying interest and a potential continuation of the uptrend. Additionally, the volume has been increasing during the recent recovery, which is a bullish sign. Therefore, I recommend a "buy" verdict for this weekly data.</td>
</tr>

<tr>
  <td>BAC</td>
  <td>Buy</td>
  <td>The stock price has been in an overall uptrend since 2019, with several support levels and key reversals indicating buying opportunities. Most recently, the stock formed an inverse head and shoulders pattern between March 2023 and April 2024, which typically signals a reversal in the downtrend and a potential continuation of the uptrend. The price broke above the neckline of this pattern at $37.11 on April 1, 2024, further supporting a bullish outlook. Additionally, the volume during the breakout was higher than the previous volume spikes, indicating strong buying interest. Therefore, a buy recommendation is warranted.</td>
</tr>


<tr>
    <td>CCZ</td>
    <td>Neutral</td>
    <td>Based on the weekly price data provided, there are no clear buy or sell signals from the technical indicators we are considering. There is a potential key reversal pattern in the last data point, but it is not yet confirmed as there is no price action yet this week. Additionally, there is a lack of significant volume to confirm any potential trend changes. Therefore, a neutral stance is recommended until more data becomes available.</td>
</tr>

  <td>COST</td>
  <td>Sell</td>
  <td>The stock price has been in a downtrend for the past few weeks, with lower highs and lower lows. Additionally, the stock has formed a double top pattern, which is typically a bearish signal.

There have been several bearish patterns identified, including a head and shoulders pattern completed in March 2024 and a key reversal on April 8, 2024. Additionally, the stock formed a double top pattern in April 2024, which is a bearish signal. Volume has been decreasing as the price has declined, which is often a sign of weak demand and further downward pressure. Based on this analysis, it is recommended to sell this stock.</td>
</tr>

<tr>
    <td>CVX</td>
    <td>Buy</td>
    <td>The stock price has been in an uptrend since 2019, with several key reversals and higher highs and higher lows. The stock has recently broken out above a key resistance level at 160, indicating a potential continuation of the uptrend. Additionally, the volume has been increasing during the recent uptrend, which is a bullish sign. Therefore, I recommend a 'buy' verdict.</td>
</tr>


<tr>
  <td>DIS</td>
  <td>Neutral</td>
  <td>Based on the weekly price data from 2019-04-08 to 2024-04-14, there are no clear bullish or bearish patterns such as price action, head and shoulders, inverse head and shoulders, key reversals, double bottom, double top, Adam and Eve double top, or Adam and Eve double bottom.

</tr>

<tr>
<td>FMX</td>
<td>Buy</td>
<td>The stock price has been in an overall uptrend since 2019, with several support levels and key reversals indicating buying opportunities. Most recently, the stock formed an "Adam and Eve double bottom" pattern between March 11 and April 1, 2024, with a strong rebound and break above the neckline at $131.11. This bullish pattern suggests further upside potential. Additionally, volume has been increasing during the recent uptrend, which is a positive sign. However, it is important to note that the stock has encountered resistance around the $130 level in the past, so it is possible that the stock may consolidate or pull back before continuing its uptrend. Nonetheless, the overall trend and recent bullish patterns suggest that this stock is a buy at the current price.</td>
</tr>

<tr>
  <td>GOOG</td>
  <td>Sell</td>
  <td>The stock price has been in an uptrend for a while, but the most recent weekly candle (2024-04-08) shows a bearish reversal pattern known as "inverted head and shoulders." This pattern is typically a strong reversal signal, indicating that the uptrend may be coming to an end. Additionally, volume has been decreasing in recent weeks, which can also be a bearish sign. Therefore, I would recommend selling this stock at its current price.</td>
</tr>


<tr>
  <td>HD</td>
  <td>Sell</td>
  <td>The stock price has been in a downtrend for the past few weeks, with lower highs and lower lows. This is a bearish sign. Additionally, the stock has formed a double top pattern, which is also a bearish signal. The double top pattern is created by two consecutive peaks at roughly the same level, with a trough in between. This pattern indicates that the stock has reached a resistance level and is likely to decline. Furthermore, volume has been decreasing as the price has been declining, which is another bearish signal. Therefore, I would recommend selling this stock.</td>
</tr>

  <td>JNJ</td>
  <td>Sell</td>
  <td>The stock price has been in a downtrend over the past few weeks, with lower highs and lower lows. Additionally, the stock has formed a double top pattern, which is typically a bearish signal.

In the past 10 weeks, the price has formed a double bottom pattern at around 182-183, indicating a potential reversal in trend. Additionally, the volume has increased during the formation of the second bottom, adding credence to the bullish signal. The neckline of the double bottom pattern is around 190, which was broken last week, confirming the bullish reversal. The target price for this pattern is around 210, making this a favorable entry point for a long position.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
  <td>KO</td>
  <td>Buy</td>
  <td>Based on the weekly price data provided, the stock has been in an uptrend since April 2019, with several key resistance levels broken. The most recent resistance level of 61.20 was broken in March 2024, indicating a potential continuation of the uptrend.
