This candle has a small lower body with a long upper wick, indicating that the price tried to rise but was unable to sustain the gains and eventually closed near the opening price.<br /><br />**Technical Indicators:**<br /><br />- **Relative Strength Index (RSI):** The RSI for this candle is 4.8129, which is quite low, suggesting that the stock may be oversold.<br />- **Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD):** The MACD is still positive, indicating that the overall trend is still bullish.<br /><br />**Candle Analysis:** Despite the bearish nature of the last candle, it may not be the best time to be bearish just yet. It would be advisable to wait for further confirmation of a trend reversal, such as a break below the 50-day moving average or a lower close on higher volume. For now, it might be best to maintain a neutral stance or consider smaller, conservative positions.<br /><br />**Opening Prices of Previous Candles:**<br /><br />| **Date** | **Opening Price** |<br />| --- | --- |<br />| 2024-06-19 | 201.59504556412116 |<br />| 2024-06-18 | 191.29915478559235 |<br />| 2024-06-17 | 186.0175994873047 |<br />| 2024-06-16 | 191.29915478559235 |<br />| 2024-06-15 | 182.32260417300725 |<br />| 2024-06-14 | 182.80254997253417 |<br />| 2024-06-13 | 191.29915478559235 |<br />| 2024-06-12 | 201.59504556412116 |<br />| 2024-06-11 | 209.67999267578125 |<br />| 2024-06-10 | 213.92999267578125 |<br /><br />**Highs and Lows of Previous Candles:**<br /><br />| **Date** | **Highest Price** | **Lowest Price** |<br />| --- | --- | --- |<br />| 2024-06-20 | 214.24000549316406 | 208.85000610351562 |<br />| 2024-06-19 | 201.59504556412116 | 201.59504556412116 |<br />| 2024-06-18 | 191.29915478559235 | 186.0175994873047 |<br />| 2024-06-17 | 191.29915478559235 | 182.80254997253417 |<br />| 2024-06-16 | 191.29915478559235 | 182.32260417300725 |<br />| 2024-06-15 | 191.29915478559235 | 182.32260417300725 |<br />| 2024-06-14 | 191.29915478559235 | 182.80254997253417 |<br />| 2024-06-13 | 191.29915478559235 | 190.53339947570801 |<br />| 2024-06-12 | 209.67999267578125 | 208.85000610351562 |<br />| 2024-06-11 | 209.67999267578125 | 209.67999267578125 |<br />| 2024-06-10 | 213.92999267578125 | 213.92999267578125 |</td></tr><tr class='daily-child-data'><td>2024-06-18</td><td>bearish</td><tr class='daily-child-data'><td colspan='2'>**Technical Analysis Report**______________________________________________<br /><br />**Last Closing Candle Data:** ______________________________________________<br /><br />| **Property**          | **Value**                                                        |<br />|-----------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------|<br />| Date                | 2024-06-18                                                       |<br />| Open                | 217.58999633789062                                               |<br />| High                | 218.6300048828125                                               |<br />| Low                 | 213.0                                                           |<br />| Close               | 214.2899932861328                                               |<br />| Adj Close            | 214.2899932861328                                               |<br />| Volume              | 79854200                                                        |<br /><br />**Technical Indicators:** ______________________________________________<br /><br />| **Indicator**          | **Value**                                                        |<br />|-----------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------|<br />| Close vs Open         | The close is lower than the open                                |<br />| SMA_50                | 182.88219940185547                                               |<br />| SMA_200              | 183.7856002807617                                               |<br />| EMA_50               | Above the closing price                                          |<br />| EMA_200              | Above the closing price                                          |<br />| RSI_14               | 42.47584320330585                                               |<br />| MACD_12_26_12        | -2.508117405570175                                              |<br />| MACDh_12_26_12      | Below the MACD line                                             |<br />| BB_20_2.0            | Close is near the lower Bollinger Band                           |<br />| STOCHk_14_3_3        | 80.76041239474082                                              |<br />| ATRr_14              | 3.420113598222926                                               |<br /><br />**Observations:** ________________________________________________________<br /><br />* The close is lower than the open, indicating a bearish signal.<br />* The close is below both the 50-day SMA and 200-day SMA, which are bearish signals.<br />* The EMA_50 and EMA_200 are above the closing price, which is a bearish signal.<br />* The RSI_14 is in neutral territory and doesn't provide a clear signal.<br />* The MACD is negative and the signal line is below the MACD line, which is a bearish signal.<br />* The close is near the lower Bollinger Band, which is a bearish signal.<br />* The Stochastic Oscillator is in overbought territory, suggesting a potential downward correction.<br />* The Average True Range indicates high volatility.<br /><br />Based on the technical analysis of the last closing candle, a bearish outlook is suggested.

This indicates a potential trend reversal or a pause in the downtrend. The volume for this candle is slightly above the average volume of the previous 90 days, suggesting some interest and activity in the stock. However, the volume is not significantly higher than usual, so it does not necessarily indicate a strong reversal signal.<br /><br />The RSI for the last closing candle is 61.22, which is above the neutral level of 50, indicating that the stock is in an uptrend or has a bullish momentum. However, the RSI is not extremely high, so it does not suggest an overbought condition.<br /><br />The MACD histogram for the last closing candle is positive, with a value of 0.27, and the signal line is above the MACD line, indicating a bullish signal. However, the MACD histogram is not significantly high, so it does not suggest a strong bullish momentum.<br /><br />The Bollinger bands for the last closing candle show that the close price is above the upper band, indicating an overbought condition or a potential bullish breakout.

Therefore, it may be a good time to be cautiously optimistic or neutral, and wait for further confirmation of the trend reversal or continuation. It is essential to consider other factors, such as the overall market conditions, the company's fundamentals, and the investor's risk tolerance and investment horizon, before making any investment decisions.</td></tr><tr class='daily-child-data'><td>2024-06-14</td><td>neutral</td><tr class='daily-child-data'><td colspan='2'>**Stock Market Analysis Report**______________________________________________<br /><br />**Date:** 2024-06-15<br /><br />**Stock Closing Price:** 159.6300048828125<br /><br />**Change from Previous Day:** -0.38999999999976716<br /><br />**Volume:** 33860355<br /><br />**Technical Indicators:**<br /><br />| **Indicator**          | **Value**                                 |<br />|-----------------------|------------------------------------------|<br />| 50-day SMA             | 159.9382000732422                          |<br />| 200-day SMA            | 159.81420013427734                          |<br />| 50-day EMA            | 159.8142000732422                          |<br />| 200-day EMA            | 159.81420013427734                          |<br />| 14-day RSI             | 42.52862986104626                          |<br />| 12-day MACD            | -0.05656539351861117                       |<br />| 26-day MACD            | -2.0557962526799827                       |<br />| 9-day MACD             | 8.112361646198593                          |<br />| MACD Signal Line       | 8.112361646198593                          |<br />| 14-day Stochastic %K  | 0.4904703425167842                          |<br />| 3-day Stochastic %D   | 3.23297691347301                          |<br />| 3-day Stochastic %K   | 0.30234058428143157                          |<br />| Stochastic Signal Line | 0.30234058428143157                          |<br />| 14-day ATR            | 0.3040494526897918                          |<br /><br />**Bollinger Bands:**<br /><br />| **Band**      | **Value**                                 |<br />|---------------|------------------------------------------|<br />| Upper Band     | 162.60857469372954                          |<br />| Middle Band    | 156.90194828307825                          |<br />| Lower Band     | 151.19482830782573                          |<br /><br />**Current Price Position:**<br /><br />The stock price is currently below the middle Bollinger Band and within the lower Bollinger Band.<br /><br />**Conclusion:**<br /><br />Based on the provided analysis, the stock's last closing candle indicates a neutral to slightly bearish trend.

The last closing candle had the following prices: Open - 145.02000427246094, High - 146.42999267578125, Low - 144.74000549316406, Close - 145.9499969482422.<br /><br />**Bullish Candle and Engulfing Pattern:** The last closing candle is considered a bullish candle as the closing price is higher than the opening price. This candle also exhibits a bullish engulfing pattern, where the body of the current candle completely covers the previous candle's body. This pattern suggests a potential trend reversal or a strong bullish sentiment.<br /><br />**Technical Indicators:**<br /><br />1. **Relative Strength Index (RSI):** The RSI for the last closing candle is 53.84, which is slightly above the neutral level of 50. This indicates that the security is not overbought or oversold.<br />2. **Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD):** The MACD lines are positive, with the MACD line (12-26-12) at 0.0248 and the signal line (9-day EMA of MACD) at 0.0045. This is a bullish signal, suggesting that the short-term trend is upward.<br />3. **Moving Averages:** The 50-day SMA is at 159.45719940185546, and the 200-day SMA is at 159.56200019836425. Since both short-term and long-term moving averages are close, it suggests a stable market condition. However, the price is currently trading below these moving averages, which might be a bearish signal.<br />4. **Bollinger Bands:** The last closing price is near the lower band, indicating that the price might be undervalued. However, the price has just touched the lower band, so it might not be a strong bearish signal.<br /><br />**Conclusion:** The last closing candle is a bullish engulfing pattern, which can be a sign of a potential trend reversal or a strong bullish sentiment. However, considering other technical indicators and the overall market context, it is essential to be cautious as the price is currently trading below the moving averages, and the RSI is slightly above the neutral level.

Investors should consider other factors, such as the overall market conditions and the company's fundamentals, before making a decision.</td></tr><tr class='daily-child-data'><td>2024-06-18</td><td>bullish</td><tr class='daily-child-data'><td colspan='2'>**Analysis Report**:***<br /><br />*The last closing candle in the provided 90 days of price data is for the trading day of 2024-06-18.*<br /><br />**Last Closing Price:** 197.0<br /><br />**Open Price:** 194.60000610351562<br /><br />**High:** 197.9600067138672<br /><br />**Low:** 194.1300048828125<br /><br />**Volume:** 9021200<br /><br />**Technical Indicators:**<br /><br />*50 day Simple Moving Average (SMA):* 194.76220001220702<br /><br />*200 day SMA:* 194.97999572753906<br /><br />*50 day Exponential Moving Average (EMA):* 194.7917999267578<br /><br />*200 day EMA:* 194.91835123075376<br /><br />*Relative Strength Index (RSI):* 52.68564605712891<br /><br />*Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD):*<br />  *Histogram:* -0.851758518016765<br />  *MACD Line:* -0.3969897931027333<br />  *Signal Line:* 0.4547687249140318<br /><br />**Bollinger Bands:**<br /><br />*Lower Value:* 187.24629995581728<br /><br />*Middle Value:* 194.97999572753906<br /><br />*Upper Value:* 202.70370840453976<br /><br />*Bandwidth:* 7.453605143237114<br /><br />**Average True Range (ATR):** 2.6133368145092915<br /><br />**Observation:** The last closing candle is a bullish candle, as the closing price is higher than the opening price.

The overall trend for the past few months has been bullish, with a steady increase in prices.<br />2. The last three candles before 2024-06-17 have been bullish as well, indicating a strong uptrend.<br />3. The long-legged doji on 2024-06-17 shows a pause in the uptrend, suggesting that the market may be becoming overbought and due for a correction.<br /><br />**Conclusion:**<br /><br />Based on the analysis of the long-legged doji on 2024-06-17 and its position within the recent trend, the outlook is neutral to slightly bearish. While the overall trend has been bullish, the pause in the uptrend and the indecision suggested by the doji candle imply that a correction may be imminent. Traders are advised to exercise caution and consider taking profits or implementing protective stop-loss orders. However, if the market can break above the high of the doji candle (195.5800018310547), it could signal a resumption of the uptrend.</td></tr><tr class='daily-child-data'><td>2024-06-14</td><td>bearish</td><tr class='daily-child-data'><td colspan='2'>**Market Analysis Report**______________________________________________<br /><br />**Date:** 2024-06-14<br /><br />**Last Closing Candle:** 193.77999877929688<br /><br />**Percentage Change from Previous Day:** -1.92%<br /><br />**Volume:** 6,599,331<br /><br />**Average Volume (90 days):** 5,362,622<br /><br />**50-day Simple Moving Average (SMA):** 191.5590720741473<br /><br />**200-day Simple Moving Average (SMA):** 160.156518345342<br /><br />**50-day and 200-day SMA Trend:** Bullish<br /><br />**14-day Relative Strength Index (RSI):** 42.32<br /><br />**RSI Territory:** Neutral<br /><br />**Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD):** Bearish<br /><br />**MACD Line:** Below Signal Line<br /><br />**Bollinger Bands:** Narrowing<br /><br />**Short-Term Market Trend:** Neutral to bearish<br /><br />**Long-Term Market Trend:** Bullish<br /><br />**Important Note:** This analysis is based solely on the data provided and should not be used as the sole basis for any investment decisions.</td></tr><tr class='daily-child-data'><td>2024-06-13</td><td>bullish</td><tr class='daily-child-data'><td colspan='2'>**Stock Market Report**------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br /><br />**Date:** 2024-06-13<br /><br />**Last Closing Candle:**<br /><br />* Open price: 192.32000732421875<br />* High price: 194.5800018310547<br />* Low price: 190.88999938964844<br />* Close price: 193.58999633789062<br /><br />**Volume:** 6,491,786<br /><br />**Average Volumes:**<br /><br />* 90-day average volume: N/A<br /><br />**Technical Indicators:**<br /><br />* 50-day Simple Moving Average (SMA): 178.6080136419856<br />* 200-day SMA: 159.8298501512036<br />* 50-day Exponential Moving Average (EMA): 178.6080136419856<br />* 200-day EMA: 159.8298501512036<br />* Relative Strength Index (RSI): 54.67<br />* Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD): Positive<br />* MACD line: 0.21788687771859036<br />* Signal line: 0.00433425459529472<br />* Bollinger Bands:<br />	+ Upper band: 194.87719970703125<br />	+ Middle band: 192.85668886977788<br />	+ Lower band: 190.83611916327816<br />* Stochastic Oscillator: 50.00<br /><br />**Observations:**<br /><br />* The last closing candle indicates a slightly bullish trend, with the closing price higher than the opening price and above the 50-day and 200-day SMAs.<br />* The positive MACD and neutral RSI and Stochastic Oscillator also support this bullish trend.<br />* The volume for this candle was slightly above the 90-day average volume.<br /><br />**Conclusion:**<br /><br />Based on the provided analysis, the last closing candle indicates a slightly bullish trend in the stock market.

This candle pattern is characterized by a long lower wick and a small body near the high of the candle. The long lower wick indicates selling pressure during the day, while the small body near the high suggests that the bulls were able to push the price back up, closing near the high of the day.<br /><br />**Volume:**<br /><br />The volume for the last closing candle was higher than the previous day, which could indicate increased interest in the stock.

Analysis<br /><br />The last closing candle indicates a slightly bullish trend, as the Close price is higher than the Open price and is near the High price for the period. The RSI 14 value of 53.44235324859619 suggests that the stock is not overbought or oversold. The MACD indicators show a slight positive momentum. However, the STOCHk 14 3 3 value of 55.55555820465088 is relatively close to the overbought threshold of 80, which might indicate a potential reversal in the short term.<br /><br />In summary, the last closing candle suggests a slightly bullish trend, but investors should be cautious due to the high STOCHk 14 3 3 value and consider taking a neutral or slightly bearish stance in the short term. Long-term investors may find this a good opportunity to accumulate shares, given the overall uptrend and the RSI 14 and MACD indicators.</td></tr><tr class='child-table META'><td colspan='4'><table><thead><tr class='child-table-parent META'><th>Daily Market Close</th><th>Daily Prediction</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr class='daily-child-data'><td>2024-06-20</td><td>neutral</td><tr class='daily-child-data'><td colspan='2'>**Stock Market Analysis Report**________________________________________<br /><br />**Date:** 2024-06-20<br /><br />**Closing Price:** **501.70001220703125**<br /><br />The stock closed at a price of **501.70001220703125**, which is slightly lower than the opening price of **502.0**.

This pattern is typically indicative of a potential reversal in the market trend, with buyers (bulls) gaining control.<br /><br />**Technical Indicators:**<br /><br />To further analyze the market trend, it is essential to consider the following technical indicators:<br /><br />* **Simple Moving Averages (SMA):** The 50-day SMA is 562.9872003173828, and the 200-day SMA is 463.4626496887207.

The small body of the candle indicates minimal price movement during the time period. The longer lower wick suggests more buying pressure at lower prices, while the close price being near the low of the candle indicates strong selling pressure.<br /><br />**Trend Analysis:**<br /><br />The SMA_50 and EMA_50 are both above the close price, indicating a bearish trend.

The MACD lines are also below the signal line, which is a bearish sign.<br /><br />**Volatility Analysis:**<br /><br />The Bollinger Bands are narrow, indicating low volatility. The price is currently near the lower Bollinger Band, which could be a bullish sign if the price starts to move up towards the middle or upper band.<br /><br />**Conclusion:**<br /><br />The last closing candle suggests a bearish trend, but there are mixed signals from the trend, oscillator, and volatility indicators. It may be wise to wait for further confirmation before making any trading decisions. A bearish outlook would be appropriate if the price continues to move down and breaks below the lower Bollinger Band. A bullish outlook would be appropriate if the price starts to move up and breaks above the SMA_50 or EMA_50.</td></tr><tr class='daily-child-data'><td>2024-06-14</td><td>bearish</td><tr class='daily-child-data'><td colspan='2'>**Stock Market Analysis Report**----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br /><br />**Closing Price:** The stock closed at a price of **142.5** on 2024-06-14.<br /><br />**Previous Close:** The previous closing price was **142.49**.<br /><br />**Price Data:** The open price was **142.2100067138672**, the high was **143.17999267578125**, and the low was **141.88999938964844**.<br /><br />**Moving Averages:**<br /><br />* 50-day simple moving average (SMA): **131.18279998779298**<br />* 200-day SMA: **103.15343674688977**<br />* 50-day exponential moving average (EMA): **130.81199996948243**<br />* 200-day EMA: **102.68469994812019**<br /><br />**Technical Indicators:**<br /><br />* Relative Strength Index (RSI): **54.124989977724034**<br />* Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD): 4.543352687844688, 0.21695781808973713, and -4.326394869754951 for the 12-day, 26-day, and 9-day exponential moving averages, respectively.<br />* Bollinger Bands (20, 2.0): Upper Band: **117.26648594020546**, Middle Band: **128.06531978345595**, Lower Band: **138.86415362670644**<br />* Stochastic Oscillator (14, 3, 3): %K: **61.26271794623191**, %D: **68.40462019270335**, Slow %D: **3.3590842017255365**<br /><br />**Observations:**<br /><br />* The stock's closing price is above both the upper Bollinger Band and the %K and %D lines of the stochastic oscillator, indicating that the stock is overbought.<br />* The RSI value of 54.12 suggests that the stock is not overbought or oversold.<br />* The moving averages are in an uptrend, with the 50-day EMA above the 200-day EMA.<br /><br />Therefore, based on the provided analysis, the stock is currently overbought according to the Bollinger Bands and the stochastic oscillator.

This candle has a small real body and a long upper wick, indicating increased selling pressure. The volume for this candle was significantly higher than previous candles.<br /><br />The 50-day SMA is 120.53339935302735, and the 200-day SMA is 114.47749965667725. The close of the last candle is above both the 50-day and 200-day SMAs, which is typically a bullish sign. However, the long upper wick and high volume suggest that the bullish trend may be coming to an end.<br /><br />The RSI for the last candle is 72.19754216851985, which is above the overbought threshold of 70. This indicates that the stock may be overbought and due for a correction. The MACD is also bullish, with the 12-day EMA above the 26-day EMA and the MACD histogram above the signal line. However, the MACD lines have begun to flatten, which may indicate a slowing of the uptrend.<br /><br />In summary, the last closing candle suggests a potential bearish reversal, with increased selling pressure and a long upper wick. However, the close above the 50-day and 200-day SMAs and the bullish MACD are still bullish indicators. Therefore, it may be wise to adopt a neutral stance and wait for further confirmation of the trend direction. A continuation of the uptrend would require a break above the high of the last candle, while a bearish reversal would be confirmed by a break below the low of the last candle.</td></tr><tr class='daily-child-data'><td>2024-06-11</td><td>bullish</td><tr class='daily-child-data'><td colspan='2'>**Stock Market Analysis Report**______________________________________________<br /><br />**Date:** 24-06-11<br /><br />**Last Closing Price:** 123.88999938964844<br /><br />**Opening Price:** 124.05000305175781<br /><br />**High:** 124.83000183105469<br /><br />**Low:** 122.29000091552734<br /><br />**Volume:** 1,047,3971<br /><br />**Technical Indicators:**<br /><br />| **Indicator** | **Value** |<br />| --- | --- |<br />| 50-day SMA | 112.85280023696295 |<br />| 200-day SMA | 108.42224575209003 |<br />| RSI | 69.18697742021958 |<br />| MACD Line | 2.235322777161016 |<br />| Signal Line | 1.4703407741357533 |<br />| Upper Bollinger Band | 105.74280082835665 |<br />| Middle Bollinger Band | 115.10944166329872 |<br />| Lower Bollinger Band | 124.4760824982408 |<br />| %K Line | 3.304425255446616 |<br />| %D Line | 3.2726806379398266 |<br />| Slow %D Line | 3.191644004281212 |<br /><br />**Observations:**<br /><br />The last closing candle for the 90-day price data from the daily chart on 2024-06-11 exhibits a bullish sentiment.

This indicates a bearish trend in the market during this period.<br /><br />The trading volume for the last session was 6,276,700, which is slightly above the 90-day average volume. This suggests a higher level of trading activity, which could indicate increased market interest or a stronger price move.<br /><br />The 50-day Simple Moving Average (SMA) was 167.5681997680664, and the 200-day SMA was 173.34575004577636. The 50-day SMA is below the 200-day SMA, indicating a downward trend. The closing price is below both the 50-day and 200-day SMAs, which is a bearish signal.<br /><br />The Relative Strength Index (RSI) was 30.51, which is below the neutral level of 50. This indicates that the stock is oversold and may experience a rebound in the near future.<br /><br />The Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) was -1.0079801809332216, which is below the signal line (-0.1356792599747032). This is a bearish signal, as it indicates that the short-term momentum is downward.<br /><br />The Bollinger Bands show that the last closing price is near the lower band, which is a bearish signal. The last closing price is also below the lower Bollinger Band, which is a strong bearish signal.<br /><br />The Stochastic Oscillator was 2.2236918722115213, which is below the neutral level of 50.

The bearish signals from the SMAs, MACD, Bollinger Bands, and Stochastic Oscillator support this assessment. However, the oversold conditions suggested by the RSI and Stochastic Oscillator may lead to a rebound in the near future. Overall, it is recommended to be cautious and consider a neutral to bearish stance for this stock.</td></tr><tr class='daily-child-data'><td>2024-06-11</td><td>bearish</td><tr class='daily-child-data'><td colspan='2'>**Stock Market Analysis Report**----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br /><br />**Closing Data for Trading Day 2024-06-11**------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br /><br />The last closing candle in the provided 90-day price data is as follows:<br /><br />- Open price: 165.10000610351562<br />- High: 166.25999450683594<br />- Low: 163.50999450683594<br />- Close: 165.07000732421875<br /><br />**Volume**----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br /><br />The volume for this candle was 7,230,638, which is:<br /><br />- Above the 90-day average volume of 4,585,800<br /><br />**Moving Averages**------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br /><br />- 50-day simple moving average (SMA): 167.40239990234375<br />- 200-day SMA: 173.26100006103516<br /><br />The close of the last candle is:<br /><br />- Below both the 50-day and 200-day SMA<br /><br />**Relative Strength Index (RSI)**---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br /><br />- RSI for the last candle: 22.36283742489811<br /><br />**Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD)**-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br /><br />- MACD for the last candle: -2.666283742489811<br /><br />**Bollinger Bands**-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br /><br />- Bollinger Bands for the last candle: (20, 2.0)<br />- BBU: 170.20583187254897<br />- BBM: 165.7689030605622<br />- BBL: 161.33197424857542<br /><br />The close of the last candle is:<br /><br />- Below the lower Bollinger Band<br /><br />**Stochastic Oscillator**------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br /><br />- Stochastic oscillator for the last candle: 2.236283742489811<br /><br />**Conclusion**--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br /><br />The last closing candle is a bearish candle, as the close is lower than the open.

The close was higher than the open, but it was also lower than the high for the candle. The volume for the day was slightly above average, but not significantly so. The RSI is just below the neutral level of 50, indicating that the stock is neither overbought nor oversold. The MACD histogram is positive, but the MACD signal line is negative, indicating a weak bullish signal. The Bollinger Bands are narrow, indicating low volatility, and the stochastic oscillator is in the upper half of its range, indicating that the stock may be overbought. However, the ATR is relatively high, indicating that the stock has been experiencing significant price swings.<br /><br />Therefore, it may be advisable to adopt a neutral stance towards this stock, and to wait for further price action before making a decision.

The candle is a bearish candle (close < open) with a small real body and a long lower wick, indicating selling pressure but also some buying support near the low.<br />3. The 50-day SMA (Simple Moving Average) is above both the 200-day SMA and the last closing price, which is a bearish signal.<br />4. The RSI (Relative Strength Index) is at 56.74, which is close to the neutral line (50), but slightly favors the bears.<br />5. The MACD (Moving Average Convergence Divergence) is negative (-2.4157), indicating a bearish trend.<br />6. The Bollinger Bands show that the last closing price is near the lower band, suggesting that the price is oversold in the short term.<br />7.

The close price is higher than the open price, and it is also above both the 50-day and 200-day moving averages (SMA_50 and SMA_200). The RSI value of 55.23 suggests that the stock is not overbought, and the MACD histogram is positive, further supporting the bullish outlook. The Bollinger Bands also indicate a potential uptrend, as the close price is near the upper band. However, traders should exercise caution as the ATR value is relatively high, indicating high volatility.</td></tr><tr class='daily-child-data'><td>2024-06-13</td><td>bullish</td><tr class='daily-child-data'><td colspan='2'>**Stock Market Analysis Report**<br /><br />**Candle Data:**<br /><br />* Open: 573.359985<br />* High: 574.630005<br />* Low: 565.000977<br />* Close: 572.630005<br /><br />**Technical Details:**<br /><br />* The close price (572.630005) is higher than the open price (573.359985), indicating a bullish close.<br />* The real body of the candle (difference between open and close prices) is relatively small (0.27641), indicating limited price movement during the day.<br />* The lower wick (longest shadow) is long (0.68253), suggesting significant buying pressure near the low of the day.<br />* The upper wick (shortest shadow) is short or nonexistent, indicating little or no selling pressure near the high of the day.<br /><br />This candle is referred to as a "bullish hammer" or "hanging man" candle, depending on the context of the overall trend. The bullish hammer pattern is characterized by a small real body near the high of the candle, a long lower wick, and little or no upper wick.

This can be a bullish signal, especially if it appears after a downtrend, as it shows that the bears were unable to push the price lower and the bulls were able to defend the previous low.

The Bollinger Bands are narrow, and the close is near the upper Bollinger Band, which is a bullish signal. The stochastic oscillator is below the oversold level, which is a bullish signal. Therefore, it may be a good time to be neutral and observe the market trend in the short term.</td></tr><tr class='daily-child-data'><td>2024-06-10</td><td>bearish</td><tr class='daily-child-data'><td colspan='2'>**Technical Analysis Report**------------<br /><br />**Date:** 2024-06-10<br /><br />**Open:** 67.19000244140625<br /><br />**High:** 67.33000183105469<br /><br />**Low:** 66.2699966430664<br /><br />**Close:** 66.95999908447266<br /><br />**Technical Indicators:**<br /><br />* The last closing candle is a bearish candle as the closing price is lower than the opening price.<br />* The high is only slightly higher than the open, and the low is significantly lower than the close, indicating a period of volatility.<br />* The 50-day Simple Moving Average (SMA) is 61.78779926300049.<br />* The 200-day SMA is 60.47068786621094.<br />* The closing price is below both the 50-day and 200-day SMAs, suggesting a downward trend in the market.<br />* The Relative Strength Index (RSI) is 49.51, which is close to the neutral zone of 50.<br />* The Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) is -0.022, which is a bearish signal.<br />* The Bollinger Bands indicate that the closing price is near the lower band, suggesting that the price may be oversold.<br /><br />**Observations:**<br /><br />* The bearish candle and the closing price below both the 50-day and 200-day SMAs indicate a downward trend in the market.<br />* The MACD line being below the signal line suggests downward momentum.<br />* The RSI being slightly below 50 indicates that there may be more sellers than buyers in the market.<br />* The closing price being near the lower Bollinger Band suggests that the price may be oversold, but this does not necessarily mean that the price will rebound.<br /><br />**Recommendations:**<br /><br />Based on the technical analysis, it may be a good time for cautious bearish trading or neutral trading, but it is not a good time for bullish trading.

However, the stock's high and low prices indicate that the stock's value fluctuated by approximately 1.52% during the day. The difference between the high and closing price is 1.16%, while the closing price is 0.34% lower than the day's high. This suggests that, towards the end of the trading day, there might have been a slight downward pressure on the stock's price.<br /><br />The stock's closing price is above both the 50-day and 200-day moving averages, which is a positive sign. However, the EMA_50 is still above the closing price, indicating a potential short-term bearish signal.<br /><br />The RSI value of 64.67 suggests that the stock is not overbought, but it is approaching that threshold. The MACD histogram is positive, indicating that the short-term moving average is above the long-term moving average, which can be interpreted as a bullish sign. However, the MACD lines are starting to converge, which might indicate a potential reversal in the near future.</td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr>
