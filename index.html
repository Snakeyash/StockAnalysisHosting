  <td>Sell</td>
  <td>Based on the price action and volume, the market has been in a downtrend since 2024-03-22 with decreasing lows and highs. Additionally, there is a double top pattern that has formed between 2024-03-25 and 2024-03-27, which is a bearish signal. The volume has also increased during the recent decline, which confirms the selling pressure. Therefore, it is recommended to sell.</td>

  <td>ABNB</td>
  <td>Buy</td>
  <td>Based on the price action and volume, the stock has been in an uptrend since 2022-03-28 with consistently higher highs and higher lows. On 2024-03-22, there was a bullish engulfing pattern where the body of the candle completely covered the previous candle, indicating a potential trend reversal or continuation. The volume on this day was also significantly higher than the previous day, adding to the bullish signal. Therefore, a buy verdict is recommended.</td>

  <td>ACGL</td>
  <td>Buy</td>
  <td>The stock price has been in an uptrend since 2022-03-28, with a series of higher highs and higher lows. On 2024-03-25, we can observe a key reversal day, where the stock made a new high but closed near its low, indicating selling pressure. However, the stock managed to close above the previous day's high, which could be a bullish sign. Additionally, the volume on 2024-03-25 was higher than the previous day, indicating strong interest in the stock. Therefore, a buy verdict is recommended, with a stop loss below the recent low of 90.010002.</td>
</tr><tr>
  <td>ADBE</td>
  <td>Buy</td>
  <td>Based on the price action and technical analysis, the stock has been in an uptrend since 2022-03-28 with higher highs and higher lows. On 2024-03-25, there was a bullish engulfing pattern, which is a key reversal pattern indicating a potential trend reversal or continuation. Additionally, the stock has broken above the resistance level of 510, which was previous resistance turned support. The volume on the breakout day was also higher than the previous day, indicating strong buying interest. Therefore, a buy verdict is recommended.</td>

    <td>ADI</td>
    <td>Buy</td>
    <td>Based on the price action and volume, the stock has been in a general uptrend since 2022-03-28 to 2024-03-27, with several key reversals and higher highs and higher lows. Additionally, there was a double bottom pattern around 166-167 in April 2023, which was a bullish signal. The stock has since broken above the neckline of this pattern, indicating a potential target of around 205. The volume has been decreasing during the recent pullback, which could indicate a lack of sellers and a potential for a continuation of the uptrend. However, it is important to note that the stock is currently approaching a resistance level around 192, so a break above this level would be needed to confirm the continuation of the uptrend.</td>

    <td>ADP</td>
    <td>Buy</td>
    <td>Based on the price action and volume, the stock has been in an uptrend since 2022-03-28 with consistently higher highs and higher lows. There have been several key reversals with high volume, indicating strong buying interest. Additionally, the stock has formed a double bottom pattern on 2024-03-25 and 2024-03-26, which is a bullish pattern. The breakout above the neckline of the double bottom pattern on 2024-03-27 further supports a buy verdict.</td>
</tr><tr>
<td>ADSK</td>
<td>Buy</td>
<td>Based on the price action and volume data provided, there are a few potential bullish indicators that suggest a "buy" verdict. First, the price has been in an overall upward trend since 2022-03-28, with several higher highs and higher lows. Additionally, the volume has been decreasing as the price has been increasing, which can be a bullish sign of decreasing supply. While there are no clear head and shoulders or double top/bottom patterns, the recent price action suggests a potential inverse head and shoulders pattern, which is typically bullish. Therefore, based on these factors, I would recommend a "buy" verdict.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>AEP</td>
<td>Neutral</td>
<td>Based on the provided data, there are no clear buy or sell signals from the technical indicators we are considering. There is no evidence of head and shoulders, inverse head and shoulders, key reversals, double bottom, double top, Adam and Eve double top, or Adam and Eve double bottom patterns. While there is a general downward trend in price, it is not significant enough to warrant a sell recommendation, and there are no clear support or resistance levels to indicate a potential reversal. Additionally, volume does not show any significant changes that would suggest a shift in market sentiment. Therefore, our recommendation is to remain neutral.</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>AFRM</td>
<td>Sell</td>
<td>The stock has been in a downtrend since March 29, 2024, with lower highs and lower lows. On March 27, 2024, there was a key reversal day with a higher open and a lower close, which is a bearish sign. Additionally, volume has been increasing on down days, which is another bearish signal. Therefore, I would recommend selling this stock.</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>AGNCM</td>
<td>Buy</td>
<td>Based on the price action and volume, the stock has been in an uptrend since 2022-03-28 with consistently higher highs and higher lows. On 2024-03-22, we see a bullish engulfing pattern where the body of the candle completely covers the previous candle, indicating a potential trend reversal or continuation. This is supported by the higher volume on this day. Additionally, the stock has broken above a key resistance level at 24.99, which could provide further upside potential. Therefore, a buy verdict is recommended.</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>AGNCN</td>
<td>Neutral</td>
<td>Based on the provided data, there are no clear patterns or signals for buying or selling according to the technical indicators listed. There is no head and shoulders, inverse head and shoulder, key reversals, double bottom, double top, Adam and Eve double top, or Adam and Eve double bottom patterns. Price action and volume do not provide clear directional signals either. Support and resistance levels can be estimated, but they are not tested in the provided data. Therefore, a neutral stance is recommended.</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>AKAM</td>
<td>Buy</td>
<td>Based on the price action and volume, the stock has been in an uptrend since 2022-03-28 with consistently higher highs and higher lows. There have been several key reversals with higher volume, indicating strong buying interest. Additionally, the stock has formed a double bottom pattern on 2024-03-22 and 2024-03-25, with the second low being higher than the first, which is a bullish sign. The stock has also broken above the neckline of the double bottom pattern on 2024-03-27 with above-average volume, confirming the buy signal. Therefore, I recommend a buy with a target price of 112 and a stop loss at 107.5.</td>

<td>Based on the price action and support and resistance levels, the price has been in a downtrend since March 2024, with lower highs and lower lows. On March 27, 2024, the price formed a bearish engulfing pattern, which is a key reversal pattern indicating a potential trend reversal to the downside. Additionally, volume has been increasing on down days, which is a bearish sign. Therefore, I would recommend selling the stock.</td>

<tr>
<td>ALNY</td>
<td>Buy</td>
<td>Based on the price action and volume, the stock has been in a general uptrend from 2022-03-28 to 2024-03-27.

</tr>

<tr>
<td>AMAT</td>
<td>Sell</td>
<td>The stock price has been forming a descending trend with lower highs and lower lows, indicating a bearish outlook. Additionally, the most recent candle (2024-03-27) is a key reversal pattern, which is a strong bearish signal. The volume on this day is also lower than the previous day, which could indicate a lack of buying interest and further support the sell decision.</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>AMD</td>
<td>Sell</td>
<td>The stock price has been forming a descending trend with lower highs and lower lows since 2022-03-31, indicating a bearish outlook. Additionally, there is a double top pattern on 2024-03-22 and 2024-03-25, which is a bearish signal. The volume on the second top was also higher than the first, which confirms the sell signal. Therefore, it is recommended to sell.</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>AMGN</td>
<td>Buy</td>
<td>Based on the price action and volume data provided, there are a few bullish indicators that suggest buying. First, the price has been in an overall upward trend during the period shown, with several higher highs and higher lows. Additionally, there have been several key reversals where the price has bounced back strongly after a dip, such as on 2024-03-22 and 2024-03-25. These reversals have been accompanied by high volume, which is a bullish sign. Furthermore, the price has broken above a resistance level around 275, which could provide further upside potential. Therefore, based on these factors, I would recommend a "buy" verdict.</td>

<td>Based on the price action and volume, the stock has been in an uptrend since March 2022, with higher highs and higher lows. There was a key reversal on 2024-03-27, where the stock made a new high but closed near the low of the day, indicating selling pressure. However, the volume on this day was significantly lower than the previous day, which could be a sign that the selling pressure is not strong. Additionally, the stock has found support at the previous resistance level of around 348, forming a double bottom pattern. This, along with the overall uptrend, suggests that the stock may continue to rise.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>APP</td>
<td>Buy</td>
<td>The stock has been in an uptrend since 2022-03-28, with a series of higher highs and higher lows. On 2024-03-25, the stock had a key reversal day, with a higher high and a lower close, indicating a potential short-term top. However, the stock still closed above its opening price, and the volume on that day was significantly higher than the previous day, indicating strong buying interest. The stock also broke above a resistance level at around 72.5, which could provide further upside potential. Therefore, a buy verdict is recommended.</td>

<td>ARCC</td>

<td>Based on the provided data, there are no clear buy or sell signals from the technical indicators we are considering. There is no evidence of head and shoulders, inverse head and shoulders, key reversals, double bottom, double top, Adam and Eve double top, or Adam and Eve double bottom patterns. While there is some volume increase towards the end of the data, it is not significant enough to make a definitive call. Price action has been generally positive but without a clear uptrend or downtrend. Support and resistance levels need to be evaluated with additional data.</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>ARGX</td>
<td>Buy</td>
<td>Based on the price action and technical analysis, the trend of the stock is upward. There are several bullish signals present in the data. First, there is a bullish engulfing pattern on 2022-03-30 and 2022-03-31, where the body of the candle completely covers the previous candle's body, indicating a potential reversal in trend. Additionally, there is a strong support level around 300, which was tested on 2022-03-29 and held, adding to the bullish outlook.

<tr>
<td>AVGO</td>
<td>Buy</td>
<td>The stock price has been in an uptrend, with higher highs and higher lows. On 2024-03-22, a key reversal pattern was formed with a higher high followed by a lower close, indicating a potential trend reversal. However, the volume on this day was lower than the previous day, which suggests that the reversal may not be strong. The price has since pulled back to the previous support level around 1350, which now serves as a resistance level. A break above this level with high volume would be a bullish signal and could indicate a continuation of the uptrend. Therefore, the verdict is to buy on a break above 1350 with high volume.</td>

</tr>

<tr>
<td>AZPN</td>
<td>Buy</td>
<td>Based on the price action and technical analysis, the stock has been in an uptrend since 2022-03-28 with consistently higher highs and higher lows. On 2024-03-27, the stock made a new high at 206.830002, and the subsequent pullback found support at the previous resistance level of 201.789993 (formed on 2024-03-25), which now acts as a new support level. This is a bullish sign, as it shows that buyers are stepping in at this level. Additionally, the volume on the most recent candle is lower than the preceding candles, which could indicate a pause in the uptrend before continuing higher. Therefore, based on this analysis, I would recommend a "buy" verdict.</td>
</tr>

<td>BGNE</td>
<td>Sell</td>
<td>The stock price has been in a downtrend since 2024-03-21, with lower highs and lower lows. This is a bearish signal.

<td>BIIB</td>

<td>Based on the price action and technical analysis, the trend for the past two years has been generally bullish, with several bullish patterns emerging such as key reversals and a potential inverse head and shoulders pattern. The price has broken above the resistance level of 215.00, which could indicate further upward momentum. Additionally, the volume has been increasing on up days, which is a bullish sign. However, it's important to note that there was a bearish engulfing pattern on 2024-03-22, so it may be wise to place a stop loss just below the recent low of 212.02. Overall, the trend suggests a buy.</td>
</tr>
        <tr>
<td>BKNG</td>
<td>Buy</td>
<td>Based on the price action and technical analysis, the trend during the period shown has been generally bullish. There are a few bullish patterns that have formed, such as a potential inverse head and shoulders pattern on the daily chart.

Additionally, the volume on that day was significantly higher than the previous day, which could indicate increased buying interest. Therefore, a buy verdict is recommended.</td>

<td>BNTX</td>
<td>Sell</td>
<td>The price has been in an uptrend, but there is a double top pattern at the end of the data, with the two peaks at around 93 and 94, and a lower high at 92.99. This is a bearish signal, and suggests that the price may start to decline. Additionally, volume has been decreasing as the price has been reaching higher highs, which is another bearish signal. Therefore, I would recommend selling at the current price.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>BPYPM</td>
<td>Neutral</td>
<td>Based on the provided data, there are no clear patterns such as head and shoulders, inverse head and shoulders, double bottom, double top, Adam and Eve double top, Adam and Eve double bottom, or key reversals.

<td>The stock has been in a downtrend since 2022-03-28, with lower highs and lower lows. On 2024-03-27, the stock made a new low, but failed to make a new high, forming a bearish engulfing pattern. This, along with the fact that the stock is trading below both its 50-day and 200-day moving averages, suggests that the downtrend is likely to continue. Therefore, I recommend selling the stock.</td>
