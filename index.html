Additionally, the price has not fallen below the support level of 491.339996, which was established on April 2, 2024.

The most recent closing price of 66.809998 is lower than the opening price of 66.449997 on 04/04/2022, indicating a downward trend. However, the most recent volume of 3795700 is lower than the previous volume of 4396600, which could indicate a decrease in selling pressure.

However, the price recovered on the following day, making it unclear if this is a significant trend change or just a temporary fluctuation. Additionally, volume has not been significantly higher on any of the recent days compared to the rest of the period, which would be expected during a strong trend change. Therefore, a neutral position is recommended until there are more clear signals.</td>

The price also did not break above the previous resistance level of $590.14 (April 6, 2022) on the recent rally. Therefore, it is advisable to wait for a clearer bullish signal before considering a buy. On the other hand, the price has not broken below the support level of $565.78 (April 2, 2024) yet, so it is not advisable to sell at the current level either.
